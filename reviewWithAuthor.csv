Comme pour les 2 autres la prise en main est facile au d??but ??a parait simpliste mais petit ?? petit ??a devient de plus en plus dure la difficult?? est donc bien dos??. Les graphismes collent bien ?? l ambiance et aux dialogues qui sont bien sympas (?? noter que la traduction fran??aise est parfaite m??me dans l humour) m??me si il y en a peut-??tre un peu trop parfois. J???esp??re que les prochains seront encore plus strat??giques surtout au niveau de l utilisation des d??cors (comme par exemple pouvoir se prot??ger avec) car parfois on reste un peu sur notre faim quand on aime ??a.

Transport Fever," I have no experience with earlier versions of the game but as it is now - in 2018 after its significant UI and stability update - it is a magnificent transport tycoon game. While the tutorials and voice acting are unforgivably condescending and long-winded (which thankfully can be disabled) and the campaigns are tedious at best the free play mode is an ideal sandbox and will represent the bulk of time investment with the game if you have the dedication to augment the experience yourself. --- This is is a game for people who enjoy both the challenge of logistics routing / management and watching trains haul things because there s a lot of that. Trains will haul cargo through vast open valleys rocky mountains parched desert lake beds and european farmland on their way from town to town to be sold for profit granted you designed a profitable route. It all looks great in motion and the reward is meeting the demands of towns that will grow dynamically in response. --- Like any hobby this game requires an interest in tweaking things under the bonnet to fully enjoy and GOG users will have to contend with some quirks to complete the experience. For example mods mysteriously require a ""_1"" suffix appended to their root folder names in order for the game to recognize them. It s best to use the unofficial mod manager (TPFMM) rather than acquire the mods online yourself but some mods cannot be acquired through its database - particularly from the Workshop. In order to download those exclusive mods you (GOG users) will need SteamCMD the appropriate AppID (which is 446800) and the ID for the mod you want (found in the web address for the mod s Workshop page). There s a bit of file management involved but the exceptional modding community make it worthwhile as they provide additions both supplementary and necessary. --- Discover the depth of this community and the game for yourself if you re enticed by the idea of a new hobby in the form of a game.

Niko: Through The Dream, No suelo jugar mucho a juegos pero cuando lo hago suelen ser aventuras que tengan puzles o retos de pensar por eso cuando vi este juego me llam?? mucho la curiosidad tanto por sus gr??ficos como por su m??sica as?? que quise darle una oportunidad... y he salido muy contenta de la experiencia! El juego es muy bonito entra por los ojos desde el primer momento y tiene una m??sica que acompa??a muy bien en todo momento. Sus puzles no son muy complicados pero son variados y no se hacen pesados. Hay partes de exploraci??n de saltar etc. la verdad es que es muy variado en este sentido.

No Pineapple Left Behind, The most recent game from an openly lefty studio--whichever way that might influence you. It s critique is somewhat basic but sound. Teachers have limited energy; energy spent helping individual students is less energy they have to teach well and produce good grades. Less good grades means less funding for you. Therefore turning your charges into mindless fruit is objectively good. It makes it easy to see just how easy it is to forget the human aspect of things when your are so driven to just focus on the numbers. Things that are not easily quantifiable are not important. As for the gameplay it is essentially a puzzle game rather than a simulator. You will spend time guessing and testing different approaches for different levels until you figure out the right key. You ll be tight on money time or grades and you ll need to hit upon just the right thing to do in order to complete the level. (Should I train my teachers up fire them each round spend experience on new lessons or new abilities etc.) It s more Sudoku than SimCity. Therefore I think only those who enjoy puzzle games will find it fun. For the rest of us it is something more than fun it is important. , November 11 2016, The most recent game from an openly lefty studio--whichever way that might influence you,baird4371,a

Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition," If you are running windows 7 or later and want a copy of NWN that will install and run with instant access to multiplayer servers then NWNEE is for you. If you want an enhanced edition of one of an older title that will impress you with a modern look slicker UI or improved content prepare to be disappointed. Out of the box on my system NWNEE looked considerably worse than NWN Diamond. EE allows you to zoom to extreme close-up to see those Win98 era pixelated graphics in vibrant colour but zooming out - where you actually play when the action starts everything looks very blurry. Using the advanced graphics list now included in options and unselecting all of them clears this up. Perhaps with the latest graphics card this will appear as an improvement but I can discern no graphical improvement even when looking at Beamdog s promotional stills. I am also experiencing periodic audio levels dropping when playing in multiplayer which do not occur on the same system running NWN DE. Some tileset ""improvements"" are annoying like peaked roofs inside parapets to drown your archers. EE allows for better multitasking allowing me to minimize the game to the taskbar just like the old game did with windows XP. That is a positive I have not seen in other reviews. UI scaling is a big improvement for some displays. Keep in mind that the developers chose to make what is basically a patch report as a new version making it incompatible with NWN patched to 1.69 unlike the community 1.71 patch which is fully backwards compatible. Fortunately GOG is offering NWN diamond for free with the NWNEE purchase so anyone who wishes to compare can still do so and NWN EE will allow individual users to upgrade with overrides from the vault with as much effort as it would take with previous versions. Adding additional content like the latest CEP is as easy as ever except that the NWN folder has been moved to the Documents folder in Windows.

State Of Mind, This is a tough review overall I enjoyed the game and the story but... I think the story could ve gone further things were even hinted at for this direction (I won t be specific for spoiler reasons). This game has some of the worst animation and character designs I ve seen. Part of it is for a reason (which I won t spoil) but since it was applied throught the entire game I have to ding some points off it. There are some typos in the title cards that appear including an incorrect date which messes the story up. , September 15 2018, This is a tough review overall I enjoyed the game and the story but,garner7486,a

Craft The World, This game is a lying buggy mess. The main GOG page states it s Multiplayer/Co-Op which is a flat lie. Multiplayer must be purchased as a separate $6 DLC. WOMEN must be purchased as a separate $3 DLC. I can t decide which disgusts me more. I played this on a friend s PC and learned that her multiplayer DLC absolutely would not be detected by the game meanwhile the other PC s worked fine for no discernible reason (same version). So even after you go through the disgusting practice of piecemeal multiplayer and women into your game you may not get it. On top of that the gameplay is nothing as advertised the options are basically none like some sort of mobile phone port and there s no borderless window option so enjoy having your 2+ monitors all eaten up by this one incredible buggy mess. This should be removed from the GOG store outright for lying about its features. , June 15 2018, This game is a lying buggy mess,maxwell7694,a
Men Of War: Assault Squad, I ve never been into WW2 combat or games or anything WW2. But I took a chance and bought this game knowing not what to expect. This game s blown me away. I ve went my whole strategy career not even knowing this type of game existed. It s basically a war simulator (Editor included ;)) with surprising depth. Every battle is an actual battle and it s not like most WW2 games I ve  seenthat try to be all Hollywood instead it s basically a long list of maps that you wage war on and it s fun as hell. You can control every unit their supply ... you ll see a tank roar over the tree-covered ridge ahead and panic???your AT unit s behind a rock you swing the bastard around and blast the enemy tank s turret out of commission. It s great fun and highly recommended. Glad I made the purchase. This will be a game played for years now we just gotta get Assault Squad 2 on here and Call to Arms. , January 24 2016, I ve never been into WW2 combat or games or anything WW2,lara,a
Baldur S Gate: Enhanced Edition, First: ignore reviews from the time this was first released. Developer Beamdog has been patching and tinkering with Baldur s Gate EE for (at this writing) four years constantly improving the engine content and quality assurance and the game now is a significantly more worthy product than it was on launch day. Baldur s Gate EE re-releases and enhances the influential D&amp;D classic Baldur s Gate and comes complete with the original expansion plus several new companions classses quests and areas. On top of that it updates the original to higher resolutions and greater levels of zoom and adds a wealth of quality-of-life improvements to the interface - most notably around looting and inventory management. It lets you play an icon of the genre without dealing with some of the more frustrating design limitations of the era. There s a school of thought that says that Baldur s Gate EE offers nothing that can t be obtained through heavy modding of the original. If you re someone who must have the control and customisation of mods there s something to be said for that - although Baldur s Gate EE is now capable of supporting mods itself. But if you want a great game that runs perfectly straight out of the box with no fiddling and delivers the complete Baldur s Gate purchase this is for you. AND buying Baldur s Gate EE will let you play the excellent Siege of Dragonspear expansion AND load your game-winning party into Baldur s Gate 2 EE AND the game is still being improved and patched with ongoing commitment and support from the developer. What more could you ask for? , November 1 2018, First: ignore reviews from the time this was first released,coffey,a
Incredipede," I always had a fascination for Latin America: from the Andes to the Amazon Jungle there are so many exotic regions to explore that it awakens the adventurer in me not to mention the powerful attraction that pre-Columbian cultures exert on me. Incredipede scratches an itch then as its art (in both visual and audio departments) is heavily inspired by the developersstay in Central America. There s more: indirectly it also touches upon the history of this region of the world and while the story is (very) secondary in the context of playing this game it nonetheless provides a line of thought that goes much deeper than you re likely to realise at first. (For more on the background of this title s development check out ""Born Unequal: The Story of Incredipede"" an article featured on the gaming website Polygon.) Incredipede is a puzzle game that puts you in the limbs (yes) of Quozzle: she s an ""incredipede"" which basically stands for all life as it can change shape to better adapt to the numerous challenges of the environment and the game s mechanics are a way to explore the different forms that life takes. In effect there s a normal mode and a hard mode: in the former Quozzle s design in each level is provided for you and in the latter you have to design her yourself. New limbs are created by dragging outward from the central eye and muscles are dropped in by tapping the two attachment points. It s not necessarily intuitive and both designing a new creature and moving throughout the levels will take some getting used to but that just increases the satisfaction you earn from beating a puzzle. There s also a level editor and tons of content made by the community. The textures used in this title are smooth and heavily lined giving the appearance of a living woodblock print or an oil painting. The art direction is very good and coupled with the music s exotic (if repetitive) tunes the game s original character is enhanced. 3.5/5 stars - worth a try.

Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe," This was a real surprise. It s a furiously addictive mash-up of your standard  match the coloured blocks(most like Capcom s Super Puzzle Fighter II) and an action platformer in the vein of Contra. You just jump about shooting the blocks scoring combos and gambling by letting the blocks merge into one huge coloured ... THING! You re about to pop it.. and ""hnnnggrrryyyaargh!"" You didn t consider the fact that this coloured mass is the only thing standing between you and instant death courtesy of spikes that line the bottom of the screen! That s a beginner s error and planning is required. That s the beauty of this game: It seems ridiculously hard at first yet you say ""one more go"" and before you know it you re surviving for 15 minutes or more and getting good scores. You die you try again you improve you die you try again you get worse and do the equivalent of a Mario death at first goomba you use bad language and vow to come back later to seek revenge. You don t do that though no. You immediately try again. You top the high score table... Controls are perfect the presentation is very good featuring appropriate (for once)  80 s-style blocky graphics and some great chip tunes. There are multiple characters to choose from each featuring different attributes and different methods of busting blocks such as a ninja who can double jump and throw shurikens or a guy who can use twin pistols to shoot blocks at either side or one side at a time. I like the standard default dude: a bloke who can jump fairly high and can glide using his cape. Can t go wrong with him but the others are a nice bonus. Not much more to say other than you run and jump and shoot coloured blocks and it s a great time. If you ve enjoyed a gem puzzler a platformer or a run &amp; gun-style shooter give this one a try. Be warned it s very hard but that s how a score-chasing game like this should be. ", April 24 2015, This was a real surprise,perkins,a
Offworld Trading Company - Almanac Dlc," Pros. Beautiful landscapes Very well done graphics A nice civilization style building game Great if you love finances spreadsheets playing the stock market or want to be an accountant Cons. 1. Building your civilization devolves into a heated rush every game that gets faster and faster with the only goal being to beat your apponent to the financial finish line. 2. It seems to become (rapidly) less about ""lets play a game"" and more ""lets beat the numbers"". 3. What good are all the new senarios and graphics when the game never really changes are adds something new? In other words as said before one objective only. Beat your apponent to financial success as fast as you can. 4 A never ending payout. So far the cost of everything is up to $49.93 and while this game is nice paying $5.00 and up continually for every new expansion imo is ludicrous. Big title games cost $50.00 or $60.00 with much more content than this. A new DLC for this game is actually $14.00. Finally I was going to at least give it three stars but seeing how much they are charging drops it down to two. It s dissapointing. It s a beautiful game and great concept. I feel they could do so much more but their coasting along on making money off expansions that really add little more to the game. ", August 7 2017, Pros,pitts5589,a
Europa Universalis III Complete," This is the first Paradox game I ever bought. The user interface is not great given the native resolution of my monitor. Although there is no in-game setting for UI scaling or text-size adjustment the Paradox forums refer to mods and modding instructions that allow you to change the text size and/or mod the interface. However when you try to access those specific forum threads it locks you out saying you must be logged in. So I went and registered an account over there and confirmed my email but then when I revisited the page I was trying to access Paradox now tells me I must link my Paradox account with my Steam account for the ""privilege"" of viewing mod instructions for an issue that should be addressed within the game in the first place. Apparently Paradox has no use for Good Old Games customers. ", June 20 2018, This is the first Paradox game I ever bought,christensen3464,a

Randal S Monday, This is a point-and-click adventure game with inventory and dialogue based puzzles. I felt that the puzzles were fair. I was able to play through the game without consulting a guide. The game provides a lot of hints in observations from the main character about what you need to be doing to achieve the next objective. The graphics music and sound effects all seem very well done. The music was enjoyable to listen to for the most part. The story is comical making fun of a lot of sci-fi gamer and other pop culture references. There is a neat sci-fi element in reliving the same day over and over again and seeing how the choices the main character make change the timeline. There are several strong side characters that make multiple appearances. I would say the main negative is some crude and mean-spirited language from the main character but this doesn t overwhelm the experience. , November 13 2017, This is a point-and-click adventure game with inventory and dialogue based puzzles,gilmore,a

Star Wolves 3: Civil War," This game is the direct sequel of the original Star Wolves the 2nd game saw very limited distribution and is generally acknowledged as the weaker of the series. You own a mothership ""base"" which you fly around the star systems in the game. Combat is the RTS part where you launch fighters from your base. They are not directly controllable - this is where (some of) the RPG elements come in: you select targets and trigger skills but it is up to each pilot how well they fly their fighters. The other RPG part is the story which sees you go through a branching plotline culminating in several endings. This is no save-before-final-battle-then-pick-a-choice crap the choices you make during the course of the game change which storyline you end up on. Completing one ending is less than half of what s available so replay value is good and for a $5 game fantastic. The series is ambitious but unfortunately the writing isn t up to par. Turn off the skeptical part of your brain and enjoy a simple Star Wars type fantasy don t expect indepth intrigue. As one of the few modders of the game I got a chance to dig through it - outside the engine everything is LUA scripts. There was actually supposed to be a 4th game and they got as far as some engine upgrades but ran out of funding - I wish the devs weren t so obsessed spending money on engine upgrades should ve concentrated on improving the story and characters. The series could ve been a cult hit not the niche curio it turned out to be. Despite budget limitations the devs at least attempted something new. At $5 I strongly recommend this game - take a look at some youtube videos to see whether you can tolerate the gameplay. The game isn t too deep you can see how most of it works from videos. This could easily have been a AAA game given budget for better writing. If you re comfortable with VNs or CYOA books the branching plotlines here are perfect.

Lethis - Path Of Progress," First the positives. I really like the art-style and graphics the setting is a nice change of pace from the ""historical"" city builders and... Well that s pretty much it. Beyond the steampunk setting in a fictional world everything is just like the games it imitates... including all the parts I didn t like about them most notably the complete lack of pathing AI for workers that forces you to build housing in a very specific pattern that s both unrealistic and pretty boring to look at. Even worse a bunch of game mechanics that were staples of earlier games have been left out entirely: There s no crime no fires or other disasters and no health system. There s also no combat which is admittedly no great loss but also no diplomacy or reputation system with neighbouring cities either. And that might be why campaign objectives were so repetitive: Have N population in N level housing produce N of a certain commodity rinse and repeat with a new building and item. There are apparently some monuments/Great Works projects further on but to be honest I got bored and quit long before I ever saw those. The one innovative thing the game does try to do is the steam power system but that s handled in such a half-arsed way that they might as well have not bothered; once you ve connected the geothermal vent taps to the big central boiler the steam supply is... dispensed into small gas bottles that walkers transport in carts to various buildings Only one building needs a direct connection and you don t even get that until a fair way into the campaign. By a similar token the walker system is used for distributing water no matter what level the building s at whereas Caesar 3 managed to implement reservoirs and aqueducts that you needed to build in order to advance past a certain level. Eighteen years ago! All in all this is a great looking game with a cool art-style and an interesting setting that just isn t very much fun to actually play. Which is a huge shame.

Shantae And The Pirate S Curse, Shantae: Risky s Revenge was already a nice and charming little game. Shantae and the Pirate s Curse easily tops it s predecessor as it is bigger faster sexier and even more hilarious! In my opinion this game is on a par with the best explorative plattformers out there and while it s a bit light on the exploration part it easily makes up for it with it s heart-warming narrative and lovable characters. My only real complaint is that the german translation is less than stellar and the game makes it virtually impossible to change the language settings as it always installs in the language of your operating system therefore it only gets 4 out of 5 stars from me (really who does that and why???). , March 8 2018, Shantae: Risky s Revenge was already a nice and charming little game,morton9644,a
Armikrog, Like other reviews mention this is beta software. It s not really at an acceptable quality level but at least I picked it up on a sale. The music and sound effects stop working regularly forcing a relaunch. The main menu is flaky. You even have to click around to find the save/load functionality (how can you even fail on this point? Just put them in the main menu!) It forces me to name my save games as if I cared but can t bother to actually render the text properly in the text field. All these things add up and result is that I go straight to a walkthrough when I m stuck since there s a high probability that I m stuck indefinitely only because of a bug... I hate consulting UHS and walkthroughs. There seem to have been some improvements since the top rated review though: - The cursor is customized and has context sensitivity. - The graphics and sound aren t compressed into garbage. I was actually supposed to be playing the game right now but since the audio stopped working I just wrote this review instead. , November 3 2018, Like other reviews mention this is beta software,osborne,a
Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi, A completely non-interactive visual novel that starts as slice-of-life harem drama and takes a sharp turn into horror. With minimal art generic music and no meaningful gameplay Higurashi When They Cry stakes everything on the strength of its story. Chapter 1 presents light-hearted school shenanigans a significant festival and then escalating paranoia and horror. It ll take you a good number of hours to read - this is legitimately a novel. So does the story stack up? Maybe. It s certainly a slow burn. The slice-of-life sections have heart but they re nothing you haven t seen ad nauseum in anime and manga. The horror - and more importantly the mystery - are where the meat lies. Are events in the village of Hinamizawa the work of a curse conspiracy or pure coincidence? Believing in any answer has real emotional consequences and the story works hard to drag your suspicions back and forth across all three possibilities. In the end Chapter 1 has many questions and no real answers. You won t find satisfaction here and you ll need to invest in many following chapters - some equally slow - to get closure. As someone new to the franchise I can t promise that an investment of that kind will be rewarded but the internet seems to suggest it s worth your time. , July 19 2018, A completely non-interactive visual novel that starts as slice-of-life harem drama and takes a sharp turn into horror,glover,a

This Is The Police 2, The trama is awful there s a lot of insubstancial and boring talks. There s a useless trama for some characters. It also falls too short the first game lasted 180 days and this one ends after 40 days it could ve been way better with a longer story. The gameplay and the battles are nice. I missed the chance of using better weaponary in the long run and more front line combat but it was a good thing of the game. , October 15 2018, The trama is awful there s a lot of insubstancial and boring talks,davenport4932,a
Nightmares From The Deep: The Cursed Heart, There are some things this game does well and others it does badly. Pros: - The artwork is really lovely - The game works perfectly no bugs that I found and seems really polished - The hidden object bits and puzzles are about right hard enough to be satisfying but not so lengthy you re tempted to skip them. If you don t like hidden object puzzles there s a mahjong option instead which is nice sometimes. Cons: - The plot is ludicrous. A particularly notorious pirate captain does not make a good sympathetic character I don t care if he did fall in love. - The atmosphere of the game does not fit AT ALL with the theme. The theme is supernatural horror the atmosphere is surprisingly upbeat and safe-feeling. Everyone but you is some combination of cursed kidnapped or murdered but they re all so very cheerful about it all the time. It s pretty jarring. , August 10 2018, There are some things this game does well and others it does badly,valentine,a
Massive Chalice, Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PS69ozGcRs Massive Chalice is a turn based strategy game that???s really honestly very unique but not nearly as complex as its official description might lead you to believe. So in this game you play as an immortal strategist essentially. You and your talking chalice work together to run a kingdom that???s under invasion by the cadence which is essentially a mist that spawns enemies and consumes territory if it manages to corrupt it enough. You can create keeps and assign your heroes there to rule it. They will produce new heroes the class and traits of which being influenced by the regent???s traits and class along with that of his or her spouse. You can research technologies except not really. Research is used to build and craft new items and buildings like keeps guilds that increase research speed and crucibles that help train your heroes to higher levels. Higher level parents also create higher level heroes but if you assign all your high levels to rule then you won???t be able to fight with them. As awesome as that entire strategic layer sounds you have to realize that???s all there is to it. You have a very limited space to build and engineering your bloodlines turns into more of a chore with the more keeps you get. Your time out of battles will be almost entirely spent replacing dead heroes in non combat roles and just repeating the same drudgerous tasks over and over again. And that gets old fast. There are special events that pop up as well on that strategic layer that allows you to make a choice of how to handle situations. These situations can either lead to you gaining or losing a hero or maybe even suffering an invasion in a critical location in your kingdom because you thought opening what was essentially pandora???s box was a good idea.

Cosmo S Cosmic Adventure, Graphics: Cosmo s Cosmic Adventure is bright and cheerful until it suddenly isn t. Using a 3 layer parallax 16 color EGA graphics it manages to look quite advanced for the era in many ways while looking delightfully dated in others. However this also is a detriment in that many of the later areas are incredibly busy in the background to the detriment of being unable to tell platform from background. This is especially prevalent in the second episode. Sound &amp; Music: Bobby Prince provides the adlib music in his typical colorful way while the PC speaker provides sounds that are often deep and sweeping. My only suggestion is to use the MIXER command to adjust the volume down a bit. Control: This is where things become a little complicated. Cosmo himself moves 8 pixels at one time which is a very large stride compared to contemporary games. As such precision movement is all but veritably impossible. Of note this is also where Cosmo???s standout feature comes to mind. His hands which are suction cups allow him to cling to walls. This is easy enough to activate but doesn???t work on icy surfaces very well. Difficulty: This is where the game takes the most points off. It starts out rather easily but due to a combination of many factors it ceases to be reasonable 3 levels in. Factors such as poor lead distance between the player character and the camera the aforementioned controls enemy placement (often being just off screen or out of reach) and deliberate design decisions. Overall I commend the programmers for making the game but I cannot say the level design is fair. Give it a try with the shareware episode first and if you enjoy it enjoy 27 levels of platforming &amp; pouncing. , October 6 2018, Graphics: Cosmo s Cosmic Adventure is bright and cheerful until it suddenly isn t,molina6504,a
Party Hard 2, This game makes a number of improvements on the original that really shined up what was a good concept. It takes many of the great elements of 2D stealth games and puts them together in a fun package. I enjoyed Monaco with friends and this is in a related vein.

Rogue Wizards, the game s nothing special to begin with very mobile-friendly (not a compliment) but could be okay for a few hours of turn-based dungeon crawling and loot gathering except enemies scale to your level negating every sense of progression. that alone is a dealbreaker no game ever should have it or at least it should be optional but on top of it most enemies have really annoying behavior: blobs multiplicating endlessly ice sliding you across the screen even if you re not moving mobs throwing goo on the screen(!) covering it and so on. and the icing on this crap cake is a bug connected to the mud on the screen: if you open the inventory while it s still on your reward is a black screen and if you press esc there goes your hud/ui (hotbar health bar everything) and most likely you ll just die as a consequence. maybe you don t find certain mechanics annoying but avoid this lazy and broken game even on sale or in a bundle. , July 10 2018, the game s nothing special to begin with very mobile-friendly (not a compliment) but could be okay for a few hours of turn-based dungeon crawling and loot gathering except enemies scale to your level negating every sense of progression,wiley3904,a

System Shock: Enhanced Edition, An excellent update of one of the best PC games ever. More than an FPS System Shock induces you to think constantly manage your resources cautiously and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The atmosphere tension and storyline that unfolds through logs emails and other scraps of information help build a terrifically immersive world. You tend to  visitCitadel Station rather than play the game. Once you get over the unique controls (switching between mouselook for aiming and the mouse for managing your equipment etc) and that this is NOT a run-n-gun Doom-clone you really begin to inhabit the station and the storyline. Exploring and progressing while mutants continually spawn behind keeps the tension high but the balance of challenge and reward is just right throughout. I actually played this as a kid but was too terrified to progress very far and it was only after finishing the (actually much scarier) sequel I decided to revisit the original and -oh my -it still retains its terror and charm. Thoroughly and unreservedly recommended. , October 31 2018, An excellent update of one of the best PC games ever,farrell9160,a

Mainlining," You are an MI7 agent who investigates crimes via your computer desktop finds evidence and requests arrests. Throughout the game you will uncover and attempt to foil a plot to overthrow MI7. Pros: + Music + Charming parodies Cons: - Bugs - Limited functionality - Bad/Confusing design - Poor and confusing English at times This game is a story that only progresses when you perform certain actions. Also this game IS NOT a hacking simulator. The most ""hacking"" that you ll do in the game is guessing passwords based on their hints. The name of the ""iphack"" command is misleading. The parodies such as the Windows XP blue screen of death XP account icons and the Ubuntu start up music are fairly amusing. There are many bugs but none of the bugs that I encountered were game breaking. However I needed to restart a mission so I could complete it due to the console erasing the current line every time ""u"" was pressed. You are very limited in what you can do. For example you can t save your notes or move the cursor away from the end of the line. This becomes annoying because the game attempts to simulate real world machines but it does it in a very limited and often incorrect way. This leads to time being wasted on experimentation. The interface has many problems such as your notes being deleted if you close the window and words overlapping at times. Also some elements of the game are really confusing. For example some files that you need to upload in order to make an arrest don t make sense such as the code file with the single line ""run_game()"". Usually the dialog is fine but at times characters suddenly become difficult to understand.

Battlezone 98 Redux - The Red Odyssey, I will preface this by saying I ve not played this version but I have played the original freeware version and I can say this; even with cheats this add-on is HARD. Even if you have unlimited resources ammo and health and perfect RADAR there are some missions where this may not matter if you aren t careful so this is certainly not an add-on for the uninitiated; enemies that can outnumber you 2 or even 3 to one - who can appear out of perfect stealth by the way - can utterly overwhelm you if you re not careful and mistakes are brutally punished. The escort missions are hell; you have to escort something to safety but that doesn t exist and the power of the enemies coming at you is more than enough to reduce you and your wingmen to biometal bits strewn across the surface of whatever godforsaken planet you find yourself on. Even on missions where you have bases to build and factories to replenish losses the frequency of attacks coupled with the intensity of each wave means it can be difficult to recover from one before the next crashes against your beleaguered defences. Basically the challenge of this add-on is often artificial in nature and the advantages granted to the enemy are often unfair in proportion. I would not recommend this game to someone who hasn t at the very least completed the Red Menace campaign from the base game with flying colours and improved greatly upon it as the Red Odyssey s two campaigns will push your ability to the limit. , December 30 2017, I will preface this by saying I ve not played this version but I have played the original freeware version and I can say this; even with cheats this add-on is HARD,serrano5407,a
Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.2 Watanagashi, TL;DR: good game that drags at times and has a main character that is pretty frustrating at times; despite this the story and characters (besides the main character) are really interesting and seriously creepy at times. If I had to gage my interest with the game and series as a whole it d be a 5. Really interesting story and the way it handles characters is briliant spending more than enough time building them up to the point where you like them as isand flips everything upside down. All except for the MC. This guy is seriously dumber than bricks and evokes no sympathy because of how utterly stupid he can be. Don t get me wrong most of the time he s a good main character but paticularly towards the end he seems to loose all ability to think rationally and almost dies not once but twice. It s like someone walking into an aligaors mouth then being surprised it clamped down. There will be more than a couple times where you flail your arms at the screen and curse at the MC. Also the character building can be pretty long so keep in mind it takes it s time getting to the good bits but it s worth it if you have the attention span for hours of reading to get to your first real scare but once it does the game is really intense and interesting making you wonder if the people around you are who you think.

Vertical Drop Heroes HD," I played the original Vertical Drop Heroes when it was a free flash game and liked it so much I purchased this shiny new HD version right away. But this new version did not just have updated graphics and gameplay tweaks. It was almost a completely different game. Once I got past my initial disappointment at the differences though I really began to enjoy myself. The Good: This is a friendly game. From the cartoon fantasy hero aesthetic to the engaging soundtrack to the speedy way you can pick a totally unique hero and drop right into the action it is all put together in such a way that makes the entire experience feel fun light and crispy. The game manages to combine a large number of useful hero traits moves and powers together without feeling overwhelming or slowing things down at all. That makes this game perfect to play with a friend though you can also pretty much master the game alone in just a few hours. In every way this is a ""rougelite"" game with all the randomness and constant dying you would expect but without having the weight of a game like Spelunky which might otherwise have been prohibitive to more casual gamers. The Bad: Most of the problems I had with the game had to do with how different it was from the original free version (that you can still play on flash-game platforms like Kongregate and Armor Games). The original game focused more on the ""Vertical"" of Vertical Drop Heroes with a slower pace and more emphasis on falling down through a vertical maze. There was much less randomness too as you could switch your hero class whenever you found the right cages to open in a level. The HD version of the game focuses more on the ""Heroes"" part of the title with a larger emphasis on unlocking future traits powers and weapons for future play-throughs. There is more action and less choice. Is this truly a bad thing though? It depends on what you want from this game. I can personally play and enjoy either version appreciating the way they feel different. I should also mention there were a few bugs as I played. Occasionally the music would stop or restart as I played a level which was not game-breaking but it was distracting as the soundtrack is pretty energetic. There were times my characters would get stuck on corners of boxes or on top of invisible glitch boxes. My game crashed one time at the end of a 40 minute play-through at the exact instant I killed the final boss. For anyone who has played any kind of rougelike game perhaps you understand how frustrating that was. (I have since played through twice more without problems.) The Verdict: This game is fast and fun. It is not so simple that you can be completely mindless when you play but it is not overly thoughtful to the point where the action slows down or where you will get stuck making characters and making choices. You will die allot but not nearly as often as you will with other rougelike games (I died about 30 times before I finished this game compared to the 300+ times I died in Spelunky without even finishing it once). So if you are okay with a game that definitely falls into the ""rougelite"" category and especially if you are looking for something simpler to play with friends this is a good choice. It is certainly worth the $4.50 I paid for it as a fan of the genre.

Alice Vr, I thought the idea of a sci-fi version of Alice in Wonderlands sounded like a very interesting concept but what got made was just average. Not bad mind you just average. From the graphics performance options puzzles story I can think of much worse games but can also think of much better. For starters outside of mentioning of characters names from the Alice in Wonderland universe you never actually get to meet any of them. The story also just kind of ends without any real finale. It isn t even a case of being setup for a sequel so much as it just ends with no real resolution. Throughout the game it seems to allude to a grand conspiracy or secret that will be revealed but nothing ever is. It seems to set up a much bigger payoff that never happens. You also get a hint of a moral dilemma when you have the option of getting power for your space ship but at the expense of the planet you are getting it from. No consequences for your actions ever take place though. The graphics are decent but not great. You won t be thinking at any time that you re playing the next Crysis but they re not an eye sore either. I did notice that a constant issue throughout much of the game was that certain textures mainly rocks or parts of walls would flicker very often from their normal color to black and back again. Not game breaking but annoying. Seeing that the last update was over a year ago I doubt these flickering textures will be fixed. The performance overall was good. My usual frame rate was 90-100 FPS but I had drops to the 40 s and 50 s sometimes for short periods of a few seconds. It was kind of weird as at no point in the game is a lot going on so I am not sure the cause of the drops. The game also never crashed on me once. I played at highest settings at 1920*1080. There aren t too many options for those who like that sort of thing. The game has no FOV slider no manual save options no vsync option only 4 graphics options. There are 4 settings for AA though and ALT-TAB works without any issues. The game play itself was pretty simplistic. You have to navigate through puzzles to progress while having the option to take fuel you find lying around. There s really only 3-4 types of puzzles that happen over and over though. More often than not your throwing objects at buttons and shrinking down to reach certain areas. None of it was really challenging or engaging. Again I didn t have a bad experience but can t bring myself to praise any part of the game. It took me 3 hours to finish the game. I did not play with a VR headset. Overall if you re desperate for a puzzle game give it a go there is certainly worse games to play and worse ways to spend a few hours but don t expect too much. I give it 6.5/10 , June 25 2018, I thought the idea of a sci-fi version of Alice in Wonderlands sounded like a very interesting concept but what got made was just average,mcintyre8631,a

Gnomoria, This game turned out to be a full clone... well replica of DF. truly speaking i m not the master of DF. I was dying by first encounters and it was hard pain to understand how military part of DF should work. so I can t get back to it ) Gnomoria is easier to handle. After 3 or 4 restarts of Gnomoria i was able to live long enough to meet 1st beasts. and my Militia was able to understand that they need to take sword and fight. so 3 or 4 died this day ) Wohooo! I big UI progress comparing to original. well there is still some pain with UI menus help (it s absent right?) but it s definitely playable and fun. Any disadvantages? you need to pay for this while DF is free. And once you master Gnomoria you might want DF deepness (may be DF will have some UI/UX improvements by this moment. the more we pay for clone the more chances DF will be improved to market level) , October 11 2017, This game turned out to be a full clone,castaneda,a

Metal Slug 3, Has some issues such as some of the music tracks will speed up and slow down for seemingly no reason and the game has slowdown. When in windowed these issues seemed more prominent when I went fullscreen the music track issue remained but most of the slowdown was removed. What slowdown remained seemed to be for legacy reasons maybe they re wanting to keep it pitch-perfect emulation in that regard for purists however it doesn t let you toggle difficulties as precisely as you could with the Arcade version (which let you put it on a slider from 1 to 8 in this version it s Easy Normal Hard or Very Hard so only four settings with no indication of which Arcade difficulty each one is) so if the intent was pitch-perfect emulation then there s something to be desired on that front. I love the game and my playtime is likely only going to go up but it still ends up feeling like a bit of a raw deal for GOG and Steam users. I played a lot of this game on various platforms before it landed on Steam and I understand maybe some people liking the slowdown being left in for legacy reasons but if that s the reason the slowdown is here then it should have gone full-throttle as an arcade-perfect port and had the eight difficulty settings instead of four. I would have preferred if the game had a no-slowdown option with a Legacy toggle for those that prefer slowdown in their retro games. In addition the music issues that do exist need to be addressed it isn t every track but it does exist and it gets pretty annoying. Making matters more frustrating is that there is a Metal Slug Complete version that exists on PC and the version of Metal Slug 3 found there has no slowdown or audio issues with the downside of not having online multiplayer and the blur filter it uses cannot be turned off. So you have this version that has issues a previous PC release didn t why? But then if you go to that version instead you re missing features this release brought to the table. , April 7 2018, Has some issues such as some of the music tracks will speed up and slow down for seemingly no reason and the game has slowdown,patterson2904,a
Tharsis, I noticed that all the reviews are 2016 and thought I should spark an interest. This game is AWESOME. I bought it when GOG had a weekend sale and I was looking for a quick nightly choice game that I can play during my free 2 hour ME time. I play Yahtzee Scrabble Mahjongg Backgammon every night. I pick one or two to play. Tharsis however has consumed me. I started out very frustrated with losing on easy. I spent daytime moments thinking about the game and trying different strategies at night. According to the Stats in the Game I have played 59 times. I have won 15 games. Tonight I won my 1st Normal game after 10 plus attempts. It is a tough game. But it is FUN.

Metal Slug 2," The short of it is that this has ""legacy"" slowdown which just shouldn t exist anymore. If any modern console game showed up on PC and had technical issues because it was a dump of a console game and not enough was done to hone it for PC hardware it would be eaten alive. This game is a good game from the a ""retro"" era however shortcomings due to ""retro"" technology should get ironed out when something is released on superior technology and a price tag is attached. So despite liking the core game I know realistically what it is and I have to hit not recommended. What s especially weird given all this is that one of the major improvements X made on 2 (it s the same game being upgraded) was that it removed the slowdown - but in this version the slowdown is back so it isn t even legacy slowdown here. It s just a poor port. Not as good as Metal Slug 3 but still a good game. Just like the other versions on Steam I wish there was an option to disable the Legacy slowdown - have it as a toggle for those who want it and those who don t. This is mostly a DLC pack for Metal Slug 2 but since DLC wasn t around in those days and most companies weren t doing the lock-on cartridge thing... it was buy the new game for your NeoGeo or buy a new arcade cabinet.

Gods Will Be Watching, GWBW is a brilliant puzzler. As stated by other reviewers this is not a point and click adventure it is an unforgiving series of narrative-driven circumstances that the player must attempt to survive. The game may look reminiscent of the olpoint and click games from Lucasarts etc. but aside from the graphics it is anything but...Guybrush never had to survive a marathon torture session where one wrong choice could mean death if i recall. The game may become repetitive if the player fails too many times that is. The developers have added more user-friendly game modes for those who want to see the story play out. so that is not as big an issue as when the game was first released. For those who have watched some videos of TGWBW know what the gameplay is and are still interested in giving it a shot I would HIGHLY recommend TGWBW. , August 4 2018, GWBW is a brilliant puzzler,cline,a

The Adventure Pals," There is nothing revolutionary here. No ""unique"" mechanism no huge difficulty in plateforming or combat. No insanely difficult secrets to find. Don t look here for an ambitious new take on the genre. But if you want a plateformer with good controls short levels geting slightly longer as you progress new stuff added at each level (a good roaster of new ennemies new blocks new items to interact with...) and an amazing art style there is really nothing wrong in this game. It does everything a classic 2D plateformer should do with style and charm and a great attention to detail. Well maybe it tries a bit too hard at times to have ""everything"" (plateforming with combat with collectibles with costumes with boss fights with XP with a pet stone sidekick with a giraffe with health potions with ""funny"" dialogues and characters...) but the flow is still very pleasant and doesn t feel cluttered by all that. In the end it might not be an unforgettable game but it s hard to fin anything that game does wrong. If the description suits you and you want a good plateformer on the easy side ?

Bloodrayne 2, First game was pretty unique in its gameplay since it controlled like a typical early noughties third person shooter but was largely focused on frantic melee combat. Bloodrayne 2 however is more of a traditional brawler very reminiscent of games like Soul Reaver or Devil May Cry. It actually makes a lot of sense because the main character was practically desigend for this style of gameplay. The only problem is - the game is an atrocious buggy mess. The most imporant aspect in brawler games are the controls and they are just fiddly and unresponsive here not to mention that even the most basic enemies are able to stagger you and kick your entire health bar down within seconds if you re fighting more than two of them at a time (which is almost always). It just makes Rayne feel like a total pansy instead of this badass vampire killing machine. The lock-on system and blocking also suck because you can only block the attacks of the enemy that you re currently locked on and all the others are free to kick you in the ass staggering you and breaking your guard anyway - it s just useless and annoying as all hell. The only thing you can really do is to cartwheel around the place like a maniac hoping that no one will be able to land a punch. Then there s platforming which takes some inspiration from games like Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time except here it s also broken. Let s disregard the hilariously bad animations and ram-rod stiff posture of Rayne when she slides down the railings the most annoying thing about platforming is that it fails to register some of your commands or does the complete opposite of what you intended even if you thought your jump was right on the money. It s hard to recommend this game even to die-hard fans of Rayne. It s just incredibly frustrating and not very fun so trust me it s not worth the hassle. , October 11 2018, First game was pretty unique in its gameplay since it controlled like a typical early noughties third person shooter but was largely focused on frantic melee combat,cardenas,a

Tacoma," I liked more or less every aspect of it but playing Tacoma was an incredibly short experience. I needed 2h 18min to finish it and I didn t rush. So my main gripe with it is that the asking price is too high for the content. This being said Tacoma is a walking simulator with some mild game elements. The main element is replaying ""Augmented Reality"" (AR) recordings of the crew and typically stepping in when a crew member opens his/her own AR interface to investigate the communication. There are also a few key codes to be found by searching some quarters and offices. The whole handling of these AR elements is really nicely done. There are very few games that managed to deliver such a plausible interface in a SciFi game. Besides the concept of displaying people as abstracted AR constructs is actually a very clever way to bring animated characters into a budget walking simulator. There are no enemies there is no time pressure I really liked the gaming mechanism a lot. My only complaint would be that you can t really explore freely but proceed from section to section which also makes the game even easier as the area to search for hints etc. is rather small. While the graphics are not top notch and there is nothing really spectacular about the world (well station) design either Tacoma looks pretty good most of the time and the station feels somewhat believable. There are lots of objects which you can investigate or throw around in zero gravity and lots of background info on the crew. Also voice acting is very good. The story is interesting but feels very rushed towards the end. Actually while I enjoyed the two hours I played it the end really felt like money was running out so they needed to cut out three chapters that were originally planned. So with something like 8h I would have given it a better rating but really 2h is much too short.

Chuchel, Being a huge fan of Amanita Design s earlier games I had very high expectations on their newest release - and that s probably why I felt somehow disappointed after finishing it. Compared to Machinarium Botanicula or Samorost 3 this title is much shorter (I finished it in two evenings). Also unlike their predecessors Chuchel has very little (if any) realm to explore - more than anything it just feels like few random bits from Botanicula stripped down and put in a sequence... Also Chuchel is the easiest game from the pack so if you look for a challenging puzzle game this is not the case. Most of the time you will be just clicking to see a couple of animations before one of them results into a progress to the next screen. Yes it still features Amanita s attention to detail the scenes and characters are very nicely animated and sound design complements it perfectly. But the whole time while playing Chuchel I just couldn t shake the feeling of it lacking something essential to me something that was present in the titles above but not here. I remember many scenes from Amanita s former games where I would just pause for a moment having a big smile on my face feeling a sheer joy and/or being moved by a particular scene. All that Chuchel achieved in that department was making me laugh a couple of times. Yet still I felt like many of the jokes fell somehow flat and most of the time they made me grin at most. I actually found myself on the verge of boredom in some of the scenes and even though I complain about the game being short I m afraid if it was longer I might actually just lose interest in it completely before finishing it. I m sorry I love the stuff Amanita Design usually produces but Chuchel just didn t really deliver what I expected it to. Still probably worth the 10 ??? for some laughs (or your kids who might actually appreciate this kind of humor more - just be warned that some of the scenes are quite twisted and creepy). , October 6 2018, Being a huge fan of Amanita Design s earlier games I had very high expectations on their newest release - and that s probably why I felt somehow disappointed after finishing it,castro,a
Always Sometimes Monsters, Really wanted to like this game but after playing a few hours I am bored stiff. I enjoy dialogue wandering around exploring and interacting with items huge adventure fan here but this game just doesnt have a point to it at least not after hours of wandering around. It has some of the worst minigames around really really bad arcade games for an ex. Talking with npcs often has no purpose as well just empty dialogue that doesnt change much after story progression. Theres a story hidden in the game I just am tired of trying to wrangle it out doesnt help my main char is stuck on a long past relationship in a most emo way. I like RPG maker engine but seeing the same game assets with even the same flavor text attached to them game after game shows a lack of originality. pros: lots of exploration flavor text npcs to talk to some vague missions dogs etc. If you like wandering round games to explore and get immersed this will suit. cons: i found the music blaring and obtrusive. no option to tweak game graphics audio etc. game assets are seen in other games even down to the flavor text. wandering vague storyline and equally vague quest progressive and objectives. Really strange starting sequence that after a few minutes I found out was just to select your char sprites. clunky UI to use items (ex. to use item hit esc directional arrow to tab over options enter directional arrow up/down to select item enter enter to use until gone or action done esc to get out of menu. repeat ad nauseum to look at each item in inventory or use other food if there was a way to shortcut this i never found out). after awhile of this I wondered why I was still playing when i have hundreds of other games to explore. uninstalled and hid it in my library.

Orwell: Ignorance Is Strength, This game has the same problems as part 1 namely it is a non-interactive story (or barely-interactive). You are on rails and eventually you end up following every update and just putting datachunks at random to advance the plot. One change is that you now have a clock and actions take time. This does not mean that it is relevant. The advisor (which is really annoying) makes you think that this is the case but I ve missed some deadlines and nothing serious happened. Another change is that you have some input boxes as well. That makes you think a little bit in the sense that you have to choose a datachunk from a profile to upload.

Warrior Kings: Battles, Warrior King Battles has a lot of ambitions. Despite it s heavy fantasy RPG flavour there is a sincere effort here to replicate the challenges of medieval logistics. This is perhaps what makes it so distinctive and interesting so it s a shame these aspects are the ones that tend to fall flat. As in any RTS the game charges you with constructing a base and destroying your opponent. There are three distinct tech trees the pagan imperial and renaissance trees to keep the game asychronous. These aren t chosen from the start but rather built into over the course of the game and they can be mixed to a limited extent which makes the game quite flexible though I found one tends to find a strategy that suits and play consistently to that. Not content to be distinct in this way alone Warrior King Battles makes a real try at a more medieval castle builder with a focus on logistics. You start with a fort complete with walls and gatehouse that can be expanded with fort buildings and a village which serves as a drop-off point for gathered resources. To represent food consumption your army supply limit is measured in manned farms and going over this limit causes your military units to slowly starve. In addition goods do not travel for use automatically; they must be shipped from your villages by cart to the city. While there are some great ideas here they completely fail in practice. It s impossible to survive a siege with one fort as there are no other sources of food and games are decided with battles almost all the time anyway. The AI doesn t even bother to close it s gates; if you re that close all farms are unmanned and you ve already won.

Order Of Battle: Panzerkrieg, This DLC is probably the hardest one yet in Order Of Battle.

Kingdom: New Lands, I am in awe! Whoever coded this was a true genius! If I ve had played this game as 3-4 years old like I did 8-bit games back in the days this game would give me every possible stimuli to utilize my imagination fully! It has so much love and intelligence within. So much spirit! I d bet you won t find anything as inordinarily combined as this masterpiece. On one side the most simplest concept of 2D horizontally exclusive scrolling pixel graphic style zero dialogue where you need only 3(!) control keys to fully play the whole game and only 2 UI elements. Just as simple as back in the 8-bit times. On the other side such remarkable deeply thought complex system of gameplay which feels so natural and beautiful. Very fluid learning curve forced practice after each failed game steady unlocks of further bonuses which makes the hard game doable after a failure. And it is all composed in such natural elegant and believable way that makes perfect sense! And tons of small details. I would never think you can put so many detailed animations and effects day-night cycle weather 4-season year and little things... all this in simple 2D horizontally exclusive scrolling pixel graphic style harmonized with very pretty music score... This is the true evolution of the true game spirit.

Capitalism 2, So this isn t really a 3 star review it s a neutral review. I m not a big fan of these economic simulation type games but my brother is and he recommended I give this a shot.

Hocus Pocus, Having played the shareware version of this game as a kid buying it for me was compulsory. I simply needed to know what the entire game felt like. And having played it I m glad to say that Hocus Pocus aged well. Largely due to its colorful cartoony graphics I imagine. Sadly Hocus Pocus remained what it once was - a mediocre-at-best platformer with wafer-thin plot. It seems back then that all you needed was a decent mechanic passable level design and nice graphics and you had a game. And Hocus Pocus is simply that. It doesn t excel in any way and although it is still fun nowadays play one level and you played them all. The level design seems to drive the story rather than the other way around meaning the entire game feels like a hodge-podge of ideas. It isn t bad but the game not taking any chances in its level design - repeating levels I have a hard time remembering any of it. And playing the entire game once I have no desire to play it again. Hocus Pocus just feels like a hesitant first step. Like a game waiting for a sequel to actually show us what it can do. So although playing it now you will have fun albeit mindless fun I can t recommend it. Since its release dozens of better games were released for countless systems and this one simply doesn t stand out. If it weren t for my nostalgia I doubt I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. , December 13 2017, Having played the shareware version of this game as a kid buying it for me was compulsory,guzman5298,a

Battletech, For players new to the Battletech universe: Welcome grab your team of pilots (MechWarriors) giant bipedal walking weapon boats (Battlemechs) selected weapon loadouts (Lasers missiles canons etc.) and drop into a battlefield where you gun down and crush enemy tanks and mechs in turn-based glory. There s a story and strategic/management layer too but the main draw is the lumbering behemoths you can fight salvage and kit out in endless procedural fun. For Battletech veterans: I see this as a spiritual successor to Mech Commander just turn based rather than real time. If you prefer something closer to the old Tabletop or Pen &amp; paper experiences there s a comprehensive mod called RogueTech that is as well supported as the vanilla game itself. I quite enjoy both vanilla and modded. The only BattleTech universe fans I would not recommend this game to are the MechWarrior 4/Mech Assault/MechWarrior Online players who can t stand the MechBay and just want to jump into the action. Missions can take thought before action BattleMechs move and fire weapons at appropriate rates for up to 100 ton machines and the AI makes (semi-intelligent) decisions at a careful (but sometimes slow) rate. The developer is steadily releasing patches with not only bug fixes and optimizations but also occasional new features. A DLC is planned for the near future with another next year and I will be purchasing both the moment they are released. , October 28 2018, For players new to the Battletech universe: Welcome grab your team of pilots (MechWarriors) giant bipedal walking weapon boats (Battlemechs) selected weapon loadouts (Lasers missiles canons etc,leon2657,a

Tender Loving Care," At first glance this ""game"" appears to be just a movie broken into parts with questions in between that mean nothing and do nothing to the movie...but that s where you would be wrong! When you realise that your choices affect the film it becomes so much more interesting. I m not exactly sure what is going on but it seems that the game checks on a handful of your insecurities and shapes the world to fit it... In short what happens the first time you play this game is you go ""Oh...this played out exactly the way I thought it would what a boring story."" But in actual fact it s been tracking your trust and distrust of the characters throughout and altering the movie to play the way you think it would. All the while providing psychiatrists notes about you the player as you make your choices. From what I ve now read on TLC there are as many as six endings and the scenes can change from sedate to downright steamy! Unfortunately from what I ve also read there is supposed to be a final psychiatric work up given at the end of the story which I didn t see in this version...which could be because it s pretty damn buggy! In fact for a point and click game I experienced a game breaking bug which wouldn t let me click on any of the hotspots. In short the story was interesting and definitely worth a look at I think TLC would definitely benefit from multiple play-throughs perhaps with a group of friends trying to sway the story certain ways.

Super Time Force Ultra, STFU is a really fun arcade action side scrolled with initial difficult that is a tad easy but set up more to have fun than challenge. You side scroll dodging bullets and knocking down bad guys until you die then rewind to whatever earlier point in the level to play alongside the  ghostof your first trial repeat. Some levels are set up where death is essential for one martyr to race ahead and push a switch or block a foe. The many characters feel unique with a diverse play style (some are rapid fire others melee only etc). Some characters are not included in the GOG edition Left 4 Dead / Valve items are Steam exclusive and while it s a bummer they get more the rooster does not feel incomplete. Beating the game once unlocks a  Hardcoremode and several characters require you collect items can be difficult to unlock. On initial difficult I only found 2-3 levels that were really difficult but 100%ing everything might make things more complicated if you are into collecting stars etc. STFU is a blast to play with an inventive twist - short (I completed it in 2 days on default) but really creative and worth playing. , June 24 2015, STFU is a really fun arcade action side scrolled with initial difficult that is a tad easy but set up more to have fun than challenge,nielsen,a

Sam & Max Hit The Road, This is my first time playing through Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road and I ve gotta say I m surprised by how little I had heard of this game up until I came to GOG. This game was really charming and I am very happy that I played through it. That said it was over far too quickly for me. I beat the game in around 6 hours without a walkthrough and that s because even though the humor may be somewhat adult at times the game is still designed for children in terms of difficulty. That s not really a problem as I still got stumped two or three times during the game but I would have compensated for the lower difficulty of the puzzles by having more environments to explore. Still it was a very memorable game and I ll treasure Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road as one of my favorite Point &amp; Click adventure games as I am a huge fan of the comic book-style / cartoony niche of the genre. I rarely laugh at jokes in-game or otherwise but Sam &amp; Max got me a few times which surprised me quite a bit.

Tokyo Xanadu Ex+," I was solidly impressed with Tokyo Xanadu eX+ from start to... okay almost to finish. In the last few hours of the game make extensive use of the ""our princess is in another castle"" trope and after 75 hours of gameplay ain t no one got time for that. If the game had been 3 hours shorter it would have ended right in the sweet spot. A near miss. The rest of the game is a blast. It is obviously an attempt by Falcom to cash in on some of that sweet sweet Persona market penetration but it works. It s not a substitute for Persona if you love Persona but as someone who played Persona 3 FES and loved it then bought and played 15 minutes of Persona 4 before groaning ""Oh gods I can t do this all over again"" TXeX+ was perfect. The combat is dynamic and moderately tactical without being difficult for the sake of difficulty although I imagine the higher difficulties can get challenging. It looks like they mostly consist of narrowing item usage limits which suggests that the tactics are broadly the same at all tiers. Easy mode is perfect for those who just want to experience the story. As with all modern JRPGs there are too many systems to keep track of but I found the net result manageable after some practice which was a pleasant surprise. What TXeX+ isn t is a simulation-like experience in that it doesn t make you play every day out of a year. I see this as a plus. It has a robust narrative that progresses daily when daily progression makes sense and weeks at a time when that is appropriate. The trade off for this is that developing social bonds with your companions is not as robust as it is in a Persona game -- there are story and gameplay rewards for doing so but the narrative does not adapt to your choices and the question of romance is... well no spoilers. It is handled differently than it is in a Persona game. Two thumbs up. It s rare to have such a universally positive experience with a game these days. Wholly recommended.

Long Live The Queen, Long Live the Queen (LLtQ) is an interesting blend of puzzle game and visual novel. It deftly weaves its roleplaying mechanics into an advanced narrative that is slowly revealed on multiple playthoughs of the game. The question is... will you be able to guide Elodie to a succesful reign of benevolence or tyranny or will you die a direful death! Gameplay Long Live the Queen melds its carefully constructed rpg like system to a puzzle game mechanic whereby you control Elodie s moods so that she will be able to learn the appropriate lessons in order to gain the skills she will need to become Queen??? or just survive. The RPG system works on the premise of classes not classes that you choose such as warrior mage or ranger (although you can choose to make her fulfil those roles) but rather of school classes. As Queen in waiting Elodie is still learning the skills she requires in order to run her realm. Whether its points in internal intrigue or archery Elodie can develop a full range of abilities to assist her in her goal of running her future kingdom. However learning is determined by what is called ones ???affective filters??? and the game adopts a mechanic around Elodie s moods; if she is feeling willful she is more accomplished at studying military matters however if she is feeling melancholic the expressive arts such as music might be more appropriate. In short moods provide a bonus to certain lessons. The player???s role is to guide Elodie???s moods each day so that she will be able to learn the appropriate lessons that she needs to rule her kingdom or survive deadly encounters. Her mood is determined by what sort of activities she engages in going to court can lead her to feeling submissive and depressed whereas an escape outside the castle walls will leave her feeling willful and encouraged. More options for activities to assist in controlling Elodie s activities unlock as you advance Elodie in certain skillsets i.e. progress far along in military knowledge and you can review your troops at the Barracks location. This gradually allows you to better manage Elodie as you move further in the game. However all is not so simple events in the game also affect Elodie???s mood and may upset your emotionally balanced princess. The story is driven forward by events that require certain stats to either pass or fail (failure isn???t always a problem but it can affect the ending you receive) and each decision you are given during an event determines some of the checks that you will need to pass (or fail). In this way the game doesn???t simply use choice as a method of determining which branch of a narrative you are on but also as an actual mechanic that allows you to choose what trials Elodie will face. Another important aspect is the way achievements are actually integrated into the gameplay. In LLtQ achievements can be as much of a puzzle to achieve as finally guiding Melody to her coronation. Some of the achievements require certain events others require an event and to pass an appropriate skill check whilst others relate to various deaths and endings. It???s just as much fun to try work out all the ways to gain achievements as it is to simply play the game. And in this game at least the achievements aren???t just glorified for your steam profile but actually add longevity to the game. Narrative The story in ???Long Live the Queen??? seems fairly simplistic at first but is actually underpinned by a fairly robust world. The story is revealed in a variety of ways and possesses a fairly extensive narrative tree to explore to various endings. The first thing to note however is that not all of the narrative unfolds in the events a major aspect is that skills when leveled up grant flavor text which also sometimes reveals additional details about the world and characters. Since LLtQ is a game in which you will die often exploring the skills flavor text can be crucial to success. The characters are not altogether interesting and far more important is how your Elodie will interact with them and most of the time seem as if they are merely obstacles to overcome to set Elodie on her path to greatness or tyranny. What is interesting is the rather extensive worldbuilding that has gone into the game??? this worldbuilding is sadly backgrounded to Elodie???s narrative but it does exist for those who are interested in discovering the intricacies of the royal plots and foreign machinations upon Elodie???s kingdom. Events in the game are fairly linear and will unfold in similar ways in each instance of play however some choices do allow you to avoid some events and learning which events require which skills to survive is just as important as learning their sequence. The game is such a clever blend of narrative and mechanics that it is truly something that future visual novels should take note of. By incorporating the RPG mechanics directly to what knowledge is given to the player (and which they???ll possess on future playthroughs) is not something many games in the genre have attempted. Graphics LLtQ looks like a late 90???s mahou shoujo anime. (Magical girl). It is somewhat appropriate and whilst perhaps not as cute as say Cardcaptor Sakura Elodie will slowly develop her own unique charm. The bright bubbly colours and array of outfits as well as Elodie???s bouncy curled hair and large eyes are often quite disconcerting against some of the events that play out (later games like Doki Doki Literature Club also use such innocuous graphics) in addition the exaggerated expressions assist in determing which mood Elodie is in. The overall menus are slightly bulky however the essential information is available at a glance and the text is clearly legible even if the font is not quite befitting the girlish pinks and roses and medieval aesthetics. The graphical settings are rather limited in options but the game does scale to a number of standard resolutions. Music and Sound The music is rather devoid of sound effects but is accompanied by a rather pleasant piano soundtrack that adapts to events and Elodie???s mood. The opening theme may also be rather familiar to many British players! Conclusion LLtQ is quite an accomplishment its unique blend of mechanics and daring attempts at incorporating storytelling into the actual mechanics is unprecedented. It was a bold move and a highly successful one. LLtQ is a highly memorable game and definitely one worth playing and whilst I have some arguments as to the morality of controlling emotions and searching for ways to achieve your characters demise in a nihilistic precedent the game is still charming and interesting to play. Recommended to: Anyone interested in unique ways of storytelling. Not recommended to: Those who don???t like replaying a game multiple times??? you will die a lot! , September 4 2018, Long Live the Queen (LLtQ) is an interesting blend of puzzle game and visual novel,goodman3710,a

Avadon 3: The Warborn," Spiderweb Software s games have always been divisive and Av3 is no exception. Either you can t get over the dated and recycled assets and at times ham-fisted story telling or you simply can t get enough of Jeff Vogel s well-paced action and expertly done world-building and writing. First the good: Some welcome UI improvements include a breadcrumb trail to show you where characters will go during combat with the AP to get them there. The UI for the skill tree has been improved too; information about skill progression is a lot more clearly conveyed. Furthermore the progression system itself has been tweaked a little; no longer do you need to waste precious skill points levelling up two base-level skills to boost your mid/high-level skills. ""Magical fields"" (for lack of a better term) add a extra dimension to combat; certain spells and magical effects now can affect ground tiles leading to some interesting AoE/environmental effects...including friendly fire. Now the bad: Some earlier storytelling sins (IMHO) of past Avadon games are still present. Again IMHO you don t get a very strong path to RP your character besides being a merciless Loyalist or someone who s basically a Rebel in Avadon garb. What if you re someone who recognizes all sides of this conflict as being horribly in the wrong? On this note Geneforge captured this degree of moral ambiguity much better both in writing and gameplay. Other than that Av3 offers up more of the same for Spiderweb fans. There are some genuinely interesting encounters and battles (as always pay attention to the text popups!) and the writing -- for those who have come to enjoy it in past games -- is as always entertaining and engaging. However this game isn t going to convert anyone who isn t already turned off by Vogel s low-fi/low-budget approach to making games. For people on the fence a large free demo is available for the game on Spiderweb s website. For fans it s another triumph for Spiderweb.

X-Com: Ufo Defense, This is one of the greatest games of all time and needs to be in every gamers collection. 1999 the Earth is beset by an alien foe sowing terror by attacking population centres and killing or abducting the civilians. X-Com is put together as a global multi-national task force to try and defeat this menace. The game begins with globe and tasked with setting up your HQ. Where to put your base is important - funds are limited as is your radar range. This done the game proper begins. It is split into 2 portions a global map/management screen. When the time comes to take the fight to the invaders it switches to a battle mode. The Total War franchise would do similar to great effect in later years. At first you will have a few soldiers and a handful of support staff such as scientists as well as a pair of fighter jets and a transport plane. The weapons and gear is the best available to humanity but not a patch on what the aliens are toting. It is up to you to manage the base buy in supplies direct the research and production and of course control the soldiers. The basic flow of the game is in picking up invading craft on radar and intercepting them. Upon downing them you then equip a team to scour the crash site to capture or kill any aliens and gather up artifacts for research. Research leads to better weapons and gear so you can fight the ever deadlier species of alien being sent against Earth. The game goes on in this fashion until one side wins. With enough research you will be able to cut off the alien threat at source. If the aliens are too successful in terror attacks on cities you lose funding and some nations may even pull out altogether leading to losing the war and the enslavement of Earth. The combat portion is a squad/platoon level isometric affair on random maps. Each soldier has stats including Time Units. You move your guys then the aliens do. The fog of war and lethality of weapons make for tense battles.

Daikatana," I did try it back in the day but stopped before even getting past the swamps. Finally going through Daikatana in 2018 with the latest patch I d say it s pretty darn good. Sure it still crashed twice and the companions got stuck to the point of having to reload a handful of times but those were just annoyances. There s a lot of cool stuff in this game and the first and final episode which seem so hated really reminded me of Sin. Part of that is definitely down to the modern setting and high-tech fortress infiltration setup using terminals and finding side routes to get around. Got a serious break-in/out and heist feel to them with that music! The soundtrack as a whole was far better than I expected really driving the whole thing. The middle two episodes has a lot of Hexen 2 in them. I mean you ve got Greek and medieval Norway which could just as well have been in that game. Also Daikatana as a whole has that type of destructible object and item pickup ""puzzles"" that Hexen 2 is famous for ( ok to some it s infamous for it but nevermind that. ). Lots of secrets too. Will definitely replay this one down the line as I missed a ton of  em ( also I wonder how it works without companions. ). It may have been seen as outdated at the time but this game looks great as long as you dig that chunky Quake1-2 engine style. That said - what is up with the screenshots on this page? Makes the game look terrible when is has so many beautiful locales. Bummer. Finally there s plenty of cool weapons exclusive to each episode. So a highly enjoyable old-school shooter with a lot of imaginative ideas then. Some annoyances here and there really doesn t break it. Not anymore at least.

Killing Time, This game is a unique one. I won t repeat too much of what the others had said but those in-game talking ghosts are really nice. The atmosphere of the game is well done. I think it makes the game a rather interesting one to just jump in run around shoot-some-things and explore a bit. Definitely worth it to most players at 2$. I remember it was a little scary and uncomfortable when I was a child to play but even now it has a certain aura of coldness which can be appreciated for some time. , May 1 2018, This game is a unique one,lopez8557,a
Pilot Brothers 3: Back Side Of The Earth, I just finished playing these games and did a bit of research. The developer GOG shows is 1C Wireless instead of GAMOS and Pipe Studio. 1C Wireless is a division of 1C Company specializing on mobile games. What this means is that the versions GOG has are actually ports of original games for Windows Phone. My assumption would be that these are the only versions which were translated into multiple languages. Otherwise they are strictly inferior to original PC games. Whereas content is concerned the first and the second games in the series have been ported without cuts and the third lacks ten levels skipping from the base right to the tropical island which is a shame.

Mr. Bree+, Mr. Bree is exactly the kind of platformer I like. It starts out rather easy so you can get a hang of the game mechanics and controls. But the difficulty increases almost exponentially with the two boss fight being close to impossible mainly because if you die you have to start the whole bossfight over. But then... it is called a bossfight for a reason! When you progress through the levels a simple but effective story unfold and the levels puzzles stay interesting and original. The only downside of this game is the length. After a few hours you ll have completed it leaving only hope for a sequel. , February 10 2018, Mr,jacobs,a
Deadbolt, The gameplay and level design are very well done with a sane difficulty curve and never only a single solution to any level. It may try your patience on some missions like with Hotline Miami with the timing being almost insane at points but it never feels obnoxiously hard. ???until the last boss. The difficulty suddenly spikes on the last boss and the start of this level requires a bit of prep work so unlike most of the game up until this point you cannot dive right back into the mission after death (like in Hotline Miami) which wrecks the pace and becomes infuriating. The plot is also nonsense with no resolution at the end. There is enough coherence to be an enjoyable backdrop to the levels but there is almost no world building and not even enough plot to piece together and fill in with speculation like fans have with Dark Souls for example. The gameplay is great just don t buy it for the story. , December 24 2017, The gameplay and level design are very well done with a sane difficulty curve and never only a single solution to any level,curry,a
Harvester, When shown for the first time at the CES trade show in 1994 people couldn t believe their eyest. Many of them were probably stunned when they found out who had written the game. Gil Austin had previously penned parts of the Wing commander series but now he wanted to make a statement in the ongoing debate about violence in movies and games that had reached its peak at this period in time. Gil allegedly decided he had had enough when he found out that explosions and weapons had been removed from classic Warner brothers cartoons. So Harvester became his own critism to this and he put in every bit of violence he could think of to try to make his point clear. Harvester is presented as a classic point &amp; click adventure game with digitized characters and nice detailed backgrounds. You re playing Steve who one day wakes up in the small town of Harvest and don t recognise anything. You then start walking around town talking to the inhabitants and picking up objects. When you talk to the right people and/or pick up the right object you trigger the night phase. During the night you re supposed to perform some evil mission for the Lodge a secret and strange society whose headquarters is in a big castle in the middle of the town. The way out of Harvest and away from all the madness seems to go through the Lodge. Judging purely from the puzzles Harvester is a fairly decent adventure game. Gils story is interesting (but hard to understand until you reach the end) but all this is encapsulated in a horribly bad production. Even today Harvester has some shock value but unfortunately a badly designed game will likely wear you down before you can experience the whole game.

Pixel Piracy," I bought this game as soon as it went out the early access phase expecting a polished product. It was not. After few hours of fun gameplay the lackluster quality begins to emerge. ** Gamebreaking bugs (such as pathing problems that make your pirates sink in the ocean) ** Obvious unfinished features (like weapon upgrades) ** Lack of mid-to-end game content (extremely repetive with ""cosmetic"" changes only) ** Extreme lack of optimization: makes fans go full speed even on high-end laptop (and it s a 2d pixelized game!) The devs ignored all reports of bugs released a few negligible patches and then abandoned the game just to focus on another game which was in turn abandoned as well.

King S Bounty: The Legend," The art is good but crowded. Your character only fights in three contrived areas at the start of the game. After that all battles are performed by troops which you have purchased. Control is kind of clunky as your troops will battle by themselves (probably to the death) without your control. It may be a good ""tactical"" game among troops BUT it is not an RPG by any stretch of the imagination. My rating reflects my disappointment in my expectations. The game is simple and includes a good deal of ""stuff"" and you may like building up an Army and going through a story where you are little involved. Elemental is a much better game but not near as pretty. However it is an actual RPG games.

Darksiders Warmastered Edition," What a lovely game to play. I just finished the PC version without a controller. The game has a few minor bugs in ""range"" targeting mostly but nothing that will prevent you from enjoying the game. The UI is designed for console users and if you re a pc gamer will confuse you a bit the first couple of hours. Apart from these the movement and battles are very fluent. The graphics are great and never fell bellow 60fps. The battles are enjoyable with various finishing movements. Your character is amazing and as long as you play it progresses gaining great features like his horse abysmal armor chain hooks etc. Puzzles in game are easy to solve. In easy mode the game is really enjoyable and very fun to play. The cut-scenes are awesome following a very interesting scenario.

Distant Worlds: Universe, I knew I was taking a risk when buying this game considering that there was no guarantee that it would run on Linux but the results were far worse than expected. It appears that the game would be great if it could run. It includes a manual and modding guide in the game directories which is commendable. The manual describes the game mechanics and what I ve read seemed to indicate that it could be very enjoyable but the damn thing just won t run. I had checked the winehq database and it seems that earlier version would have probably worked until they apparently changed something in the graphics engine. Then again it wasn t supposed to run on my system so I considered to be my responsibility to put an effort to get it to run. However the effort ended up in disappointment when I eventually decided to take a virtual machine with a pristine windows 7 in order to run it natively. After successfully installing it it would still not run. The game launcher works correctly but when you order it to run the game it will load for a while and then simply shut down without displaying anything. At that point I would consider it a fault in the game (error messages and logs exist for a reason). Failing to run in its own native (if virtual) environment is certainly a problem and failing to report whatever error condition is preventing it from running is worse. So far I have not found a way of launching the game. I gave my best and failed but the game did not help either. I m still holding to it in hopes of eventually getting it to run. Maybe then I ll give it a more deserving rate. , October 10 2018, I knew I was taking a risk when buying this game considering that there was no guarantee that it would run on Linux but the results were far worse than expected,decker,a

The Escapists: The Walking Dead, Good game in the spirit of the Escapists (slightly easier though which is a shame). One annoying thing is the Merchant bug: you try to buy something it doesn t seem to work so you press Esc to find out that you can t do anything at all the game is frozen. Save often which kinds of defeat the purpose of staying up at night and waste one night. Maybe but I doubt it there will be an update to fix this.

Toonstruck," I don t really know how to explain Toonstruck to someone who hasn t played it before. The easiest thing to say is ""Imagine a Roger Rabbit video game but not the Roger Rabbit video game that actually exists."" But it s really more ""Imagine if Cool World wasn t a commercial and critical flop and got a video game."" And I really do think Cool World is the closer comparison. Stuff just happens for no real reason. It s suprisingly graphic (the corrupted barn scene comes to mind). And it really doesn t make any sense at all when you think about it. For example if Drew recognizes Flux and Fluffy wouldn t that imply he made all the inhabitants? But if he did why doesn t he recognize anyone aside from those two? Regardless this game is pretty much the game I think of when I think of a cult classic. It has fun writing puzzles that you will NOT complete without a walkthrough and sultry hypno furries. What also caught me off guard is just how star-oriented this game is. I mean everyone knows about Christopher Lloyd but you also got Ben Stein Dan Castellaneta Rob Paulsen (who voiced Bubsy among less important characters) and even Tim Fucking Curry. tl;dr if you want a high-brow smartly written adventure game this may not be for you. But if you have about five-ish hours to spare a walkthrough on standby and a thing for animation I d say go for it. wow that was pretentious.

Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora, I bought Hot Tin Roof on a whim when it was on sale. I didn t expect much but as soon as I played it I immediately fell in love with the Noir style and the funny &amp; charming characters. Gameplay wise it s a simple puzzle/mystery game with a fair bit of platforming to be done. Sadly the controls are rather janky and thus making the platforming sections a painful experience for the most part. To solve puzzles you have different ammo abilites at your disposal like grappling hooks and torches. The process of changing between ammo is pretty darn tedious though. Each time you have to go into the gun menu change every single bullet individually and then go back into the game. And worst of all the game doesn t pause when changing ammo so if you re for instance on a conveyor belt you will slowly glide to your death. It doesn t help that the save points are incredibly sparse. I kept falling into fire pits dying reloading and having to do every single jumping &amp; lever pulling puzzle all over again. Groan. Once I reached the Gum Factory I just plain gave up one the game altogether. I honestly don t understand why this game has a health bar to begin with. There are no enemies to fight whatsoever only environmental damage that really didn t need to be there at all. Another aspect that will get on your nerves quickly is the lack of any kind of map. Especially in the underground sections it would have helped a great deal if I knew where the heck I was going and where the heck I was supposed to go in the first place. I don t wanna hate on the game I did enjoy it in parts but there a lot of little things that could have been fixed easily to make it less...well annoying. While I would still recommend Hot Tin Roof to lovers of puzzle platformers and games with a good sense of humor be warned that it will seriously try your patience at times. (Also a warning to gamepad users the game didn t work properly with my XBox One controller. It worked fine with my old Xbox 360 gamepad though.) , September 21 2016, I bought Hot Tin Roof on a whim when it was on sale,gallegos,a

Neighbours From Hell Compilation, This game is okay as a breather between other heavy weight games but on its own it does not motivate me to play it or to finish it. It does not keep me interested till the end. It is just too repetitive to put it simply. Initially it looked promising as some kind of evil mischief simulator; but eventually it revealed itself as just an extremely unrealistic and artificial time based puzzler.

Ember, 11 hrs in review and I m trying to figure out if I want to continue. Graphics are ok colorful and the characters are well done but on the landscape its a bit hard to see items or to tell if an area is accessble. The story I find interesting and I do enjoy the exploration finding lore books interacting with NPCs the quests are different from fetch quests and offer some challenge in areas others are easy filler ones. The sound track is very good orchestrated and lovely to hear while playing. the banter from your companions is fun at first then you realize how short of a loop they are on and it gets old. All that is pretty enjoyable its easy to get into no huge learning curve easy interface and inventory. Whats getting me down is the looting. You cant see actionable loot even dead npcs unless you are very close and have the  always icons ontoggled. items will then highlight if you mouse over them. It does a key you can use to display items but once again you have to be close to have your mouse hover over it and display it. Of course they decided that when you use that key all action is paused so you cant even move and search at the same time. Add in a weirdly flat and yet cluttered landscape which makes it hard to see items and you have to click the hovered name not the object to loot. Its irritating. Combat is ok but uninteresting. You only have 4 stats to level up all skills are held in gear you find or craft. So combat is attacking with whatver skills your weapon has up to 3? which use up energy. When energy is spent you can take a potion but basically thats it for your skills its then a smash fest. To attack you have to drag lines to enemies to direct who does what who takes what who heals who. so back to my reveiw am I going to continue playing this? not sure im bored theres no skill tree to level or look forward to meh story loot and combat. I may the price is right for this mildly entertaining game. , October 13 2018, 11 hrs in review and I m trying to figure out if I want to continue,mcneil,a

Caladrius Blaze, There is a reason why no in-game footage is shown on the store page. For a start the game is locked to 720p resolution and as there are no in-game settings to change you are stuck with it. The sheer amount of screen tearing is astonishing to the point of disbelief and even forcing V-Sync on through your graphics card directly is not going to fix it. So prepare to have your eyes broken after 3 minutes of game play. I now fully understand why people avoid games ported to PC by H2 Interactive because Caladrius certainly shows how lazy the company clearly is.

Seven Kingdoms 2 HD, I love the older games Caesar 3 AOE and all of that stuff. They are great. This game is the worst Pile Of Crap I have ever played.

There is not strategy you gain nothing because you have no idea what to do. I have no idea what game the people giving the positives received but it must be far better than this trash.

Titan Quest Anniversary Edition, I ve never reviewed a game before but I m livid. The installer for this game managed to completely break the display for Windows 10. My screen s colors became washed out to the point that I could not read any text in Windows. I tried my best to restore the settings prior to installing the game but I could not read anything on the screen - even manually adjusting my monitor s settings couldn t resolve the problem. Ultimately I had to perform a system restore losing tons of data - and several hours from my weekend. So buyer beware: installing this game may bring you far more grief than enjoyment. , October 27 2018, I ve never reviewed a game before but I m livid,yang,a

Stellaris: Apocalypse," This expansion provides very much needed end-game content. I loved being able to destroy worlds and build capital ships. Being able to include large ion cannons on starbases was loads of fun. It was also great to have special ""edicts"" I could spend unity on once everything else has been unlocked. The mauraders are a mid-game crisis. They are impossible to deal with if you are one of the non-diplomatic agressive races. They are incredibly overpowered and weren t too much fun to play with. I usually turn them off. You can also play an under-powered maurader with the ""Barbaric Despoiler"" which allows you to steal pops from other planets. Fun in theme but not very useful. Same with choosing a Post-Apocalyptic race. Fun theme not really practical. There are also a few new Ascension perks. One lets you kidnap enemy pops (great theme you ll never use it) one that gives you increased sensor range and prevents other civs from reverse engineering your tech (multiplayer maybe?) and the third allows you to build your ""Death Star"". Parts of it I love and add great dynamics to a great game. The rest I ll turn off. ", October 17 2018, This expansion provides very much needed end-game content,hale5812,a

Pathologic Classic HD," Pathologic is a game about games and a game about theater - about /playing a role/ in both senses of that word - which asks you the player to embody one of three key parts in the grim play Ice-Pick Lodge has created for you represented by three different healers with three different philosophical approaches to life and medicine in stopping a plague in a small town in the great grass steppe of Eurasia. Each player character has a wholly different part to play than the other two with non-player characters of different classes and social strata reacting differently to each protagonist. The many and sundry characters of the town are so memorable I think I ll never forget some of them as each has a distinctive voice and personality and philosophy which comes through rather brilliantly in the excellent new translation presented by this ""Classic HD"" version. Pathologic is often called a horror game although I think it is most accurately described as an adventure - there is a truckload of dialogue and walking around town and talking to people are the core mechanics - with a first-person perspective and survival mechanics wherein everything is stacked against you and any upper-hand you might transiently have can be quickly worn away on a bad in-game day. NPCs will lie manipulate and conceal information; prices for vital supplies will spike; and the town will consistently become ever more dangerous to traverse day by day until you find yourself desperately running through an orchestrated simulation of chaos in its latter third. It is forbidding difficult and even oppressive yet unimaginably rich and rewarding thoughtful in a way that video games rarely ever are if you can get used to its scrappy combat and occasionally poor quest design.

Influx, This could be a very nice game but for me it s disappointing. Graphics have a nice style but screenshots raised more expectations. Textures aren t very sharp even at 1280x1024. Other Gamepads than Xbox 360 Pad won t be supported well a wrapper like X360CE ist recommended. The biggest problem are the unsolved bugs. I can t complete a level because I get a white screen. This bug is well known (see Steam forums) and there is a beta patch for the Steam version but nit for this one. And there will never ever come a patch to GOG.

Clustertruck, Firstly the game rund very vell on my machine and the engine feels really smoothe when one needs to make fast turns. I think that my biggest complaint would be that this game feels pretty barebones when compared to other platforming games but overall I think where this shines is the first person 3D gameplay. As for the gameplay I thought it was a pretty good idea that was executed well. While most of the levels weren t too difficult to me (I am mediocre at best at platformers) there were a good amount of difficult levels that required me to replay them a few times more than I am proud to admit. Although most of the levels were pretty good with memorable parts there were a few levels that are completely forgettable. Although this game does not have a level editor (it would be fantastic if it did) the developer has released bonus levels post launch that to my knowledge were free to me. I picked this game up on sale a while back and I thought it was definintely worth it. , March 23 2018, Firstly the game rund very vell on my machine and the engine feels really smoothe when one needs to make fast turns,gilliam6887,a

Tempest - Jade Sea," Honestly I started many of my reviews about this game and its DLCs with the phrase ""if the aspects could be rated seperatelly..."" and now I have to do it again. Nothing changed only new contents were added. A whole new world ships equipments quests monsters and whatever I haven t seen yet. Everything nicely match the quality of the core game as well the age the game is set. Since there are a bunch of screenshots on the store page I will not spoiler even a little by saying the new contents comming from far east. The title stands for the fact everything you will have with this DLC should be the core content of the game. With the two DLCs it really feels like a standard game not just an earily access one. Though what it lacked originally it lacks now. No DRM free multiplayer no LAN no option to turn boarding on-off crew lose moral if you not fight for a long time or escape from battle. As far as I ve encountered them the A.I. of the new world s faction is more refined. Now they make full use of speed can calculate range and not just trying to close distance but the NPCs are still rather simple. The new ships help them a lot since even though there are battle variants most of them are more speed focused than the classic ones. I would love to see more contents later but this is definitelly the right way.

In The Shadows," I had the pleasure of streaming this game for the GOG Twitch channel and was pleasantly surprised with the overall experience. I found it hidden among the list of ""new releases"" for that week and being a fan of puzzle platformers I decided to give it a shot. What immediately drew me to this game was the wonderful visuals and art style. Drawn in a retro 8-bit style this game does a great job with lighting color and atmosphere to provide a truly engaging story presented with fairly intuitive mechanics. As you progress through the game (which takes place somewhere between the main protagonist s dreams and reality) you solve various environmental puzzles in order to collect ""stars"" that were stolen from your childhood bedroom by monsters which lurk in the dark. Using your ability to manipulate light-sources you eventually learn how to use these ""monsters"" to your advantage and progress through the levels. These techniques range from a simple flip of a light switch all the way through to manipulating the time of day. There is an absolutely beautiful soundtrack by  Lombusthat perfectly compliments the game s rich and emotional atmosphere and helps contribute to the gamesoverall ""chill"" atmosphere. It s almost criminal that this game has not gotten more exposure and recognition post-release considering how good it is! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is due to a few lingering bugs. However the game s developer joined me during GOGs launch stream and promised these would be fixed. He also provided wonderful insight into the game s development. It s a wonderful effort for virtually a one-man team! If you are a fan of beautifully designed atmospheric puzzle platformers retro design and emotional storytelling I strongly recommend this game! It truly is a gem! ", October 25 2017, I had the pleasure of streaming this game for the GOG Twitch channel and was pleasantly surprised with the overall experience,hayes2933,a
The Guest, Escape a hotel room. Endure the voice acting. Honestly the game is pretty terrible. Movement feels weird despite the fps being above 60. Visuals do some weird stuff that just feels uncomfortable. You can pick up a LOT of items and most of them will just be trash cluttering your inventory. New items get added at the back instead of the front. Sound is weird music from a device being way more quiet with your back turned to it. This seems to be determined by proximity; You can hear stuff perfectly through the wall at at least one point due to it being close to the object making the sound. The very low rating is mostly due to one specific puzzle requiring pressing notes in the order a music box plays. You have three tries until this resets. This puzzle is evil. The twist at the end was alright not worth the two hours getting there though. Recommended for masochists. , June 14 2018, Escape a hotel room,campos,a

2064: Read Only Memories," Point and click games usually aren t my bag but for whatever reason I loved this one. To address some of the complaints I ve seen yes the story is extremely linear and your choices don t matter. Yes there s not a whole lot of ""interactivity"" to the point of puzzles or what have you and no I probably wouldn t classify this as a puzzle game. That said this game engrossed me. As someone who likes to explore every nook and cranny all the flavor text on every interaction was a delight to discover. Want to use a carton of expired milk on a random NPC? Maybe you ll think better of yourself. Maybe you ll get looks of mild confusion maybe you ll have someone rant about what an asshole you are for offering them that. A lot of the depth comes not from the story but from your own exploration and interaction with the city. The game is very much what you make of it. If you just follow the story from objective to objective you won t get nearly as much as if you take the time to interact with as much as possible. (Managed to get a few game overs by exploring more than I was supposed to haha.) Take the time to talk to people and I think you ll have a grand time in Neo San Francisco. Also to touch on the content it s very easy to draw parallels between real life and the game to the point where some might find it ""preachy"" as I ve seen it described. But personally I found it a nice way to make you think about social issues in a more interactive introspective way. All in all I definitely recommend this game.

Crashlands, You re a space delivery boy with packages to deliver when your spaceship is destroyed by a disembodied floating head. You crash on the nearby planet and the game starts. First I should mention that saying crashlands is like don t starve or minecraft is misleading it is nothing like them. For one I still play don t starve and minecraft but now that I ve finished crashlands I m not gonna play it ever again and finishing it required a little stubbornness. So Crashlands gameplay is about gathering resources and killing monsters to build workstation to build better tools and weapons/armors/trinket to gather more resources and kill bigger monsters rinse repeat repeat repeat repeat kill boss move to next zone rinse repeat and again with a third zone. This game is lengthy and has a lot of NPC and quests you re in for tens of hours of playing but the more I played the less I enjoyed it. Mostly because it soon gets repetitive and the controls are kinda rough and limited fighting is about hitting and fleeing the damage zone and enemies alternate between their two attack patterns. A misclick means you re dead and too often the selected item did not trigger for some reason and the character walks in the damage zone instead and gets toast. But don t worry death is a common occurrence in Crashlands and most of the time you only lose some time. You have unlimited inventory which eliminates the need to go back to base but also means you soon have too many things in your inventory and you can only have 4 items available to use at any given time which means you often waste time going to inventory to switch from collecting resources items and trinkets to fighting items or specific bonus. Many items can be crafted (mostly useless cosmetic items) that it gets confusing. That being said Crashlands is not a bad game with interesting graphic design and story development it would have profited from better polished controls and a little less workstations and grinding. , January 11 2018, You re a space delivery boy with packages to deliver when your spaceship is destroyed by a disembodied floating head,cervantes5003,a
Ai War: Fleet Command, This game is one I probably would like if I had the time a patience for it. However it is undoubtedly a game that is pretty much limited to people that have a summer to burn. It s graphics and ship designs are so bland and mish-mashed that I bring it up even though I generally dislike reviews that put emphasis on graphics. It s just a hard game to get captivated by. It s incredibly slow tedious aesthetically dull and unlike many space games the universe feels dead. A lot of people say you should pause the game all the time to send orders etc. I don t want to play a game were I am constantly pausing to keep up.

The Walking Dead: Michonne - A Telltale Miniseries," I ve played quite a lot of Telltale Games and their refusal to give the player any control is frustrating. I could be talking about the often-limited choices in the games (scenes that won t progress until you interact with each item) but it is interface things that bug me more and more. I _hate_ the ""coming in the next episode"" crap. Not only are they pointless (why tell people what is coming next?) but they re full of spoilers and ruin the immersion. I have to snatch off my headphones and look away. Telltale - just make the damn things skippable or don t include them or add a settings option to disable them. It is not rocket science! Ditto with the ""previously on..."" recaps - insulting and patronising. I played the game (sometimes only seconds earlier) I can _remember_. I suspect the ""next time"" and recaps are just padding since they fill minutes each short episode. Michonne adds an extra annoyance - a nag to create an account every single time you start the game. Combine that with no save option and no option to change the controls and things that were originally minor irritations become huge annoyances over time. The interface is inconsistent too - sometimes you click in a circle to do an action sometimes you have to click on an option outside it. It s as if Telltale want to get in the way of the stories. There are other issues more minor. - I read the graphic novels and they never explained why Michonne leaves after the fight with Negan. I d heard the game explains that but it doesn t. It begins after she d already left so that still isn t answered. - Continuity errors: one moment Michonne is covered in blood; she s tied up; the blood is gone in the next scene. Same with Randall who has a bloody face in one scene and is tied up; the blood is gone in the next; then it reappears after that. I also noticed characters disappear as they walked past a window pane. - Partway through chapter two the game stopped and seemed to go back to the (unskippable again) credits sequence. I assumed it had crashed and reset. It turns out Telltale did it on purpose because they did it in chapter 3 too. But the main annoyance is the unskippable spoilers and recaps. I still find it hard to believe Telltale think that s a good idea. It s enough to leave me annoyed after a session with one of their games and it is so easy for them to fix (future and - retrospectively - past games).

(be sure to buy griffon dlc too) the top review (at this time complains) about things that are often no longer valid if you like any kind of pirate game you ll probbaly really like this game. It really captures the feel of the warhammer world. wait till you see one of those orc vessel treadmill powered with a ram coming for you :D. the combat on board was better then expected imo. Tip theres a icesword that really makes you a damage dealer in combat: quest is somwhere in a kislev city. youll have to search each iceberg if you try its worth it! I recommend you do the campaign if you buy as a neutral force instead of picking a side at first. dont forget to pick up the dlc if you can spare some coin. there are besides orcs many pirates and many chaos ships variables partys that can be a real bother if they are strong unless your well equiped. as a kind of example whats diffrent from the v1.0 version of the cons mentioned in other reviews i think there are other kind of ships but theres loads of more content right now compared to the first version. the game evven talks of skaven ships with warpcannons not sure if those are already in the game. The only 2 annoying bugs i ve incountered are crewmembers falling off (they reappear unharmed) and after you quit the game it gets stuck and has to usally be forced closed. not really gamebreaking but annoying a bit. conclusion: the ship vs ship combat is great fun especially the fireing your cannons effectivly is loads of fun!

Eric The Unready, Eric the Unready was a comic text adventure (with graphics but the game is controlled with a parser) ; it s kind of a shame that the medium should have died off just as it was being perfected because games like this show how good text adventures could be. With a list of objects that could be interacted with taking the place of the ???hot spot??? indicators of modern adventure games and a list of verbs that the player can scroll through at any time the classical problems with the genre (most especially knowing the solution to a puzzle but having to guess the word choice that the devs want you to use) are almost entirely absent and the fact that the puzzles are logical (within the framework of the game anyway) plus a LucasArtsian design philosophy that largely keeps you from screwing yourself over (you can die but the ???undo??? command removes the sting and except as mentioned below you won t be able to make the game unwinnable by accident) makes this an enjoyable relaxing experience. On the cons side of things the sense of humor occasionally falls flat (including an extended Monty Python reference because of course there is). Each day (chapter) actually has a hidden time/turn limit so it is possible to save your game in an unwinnable state; since beating a day takes a matter of minutes once you know what to do this doesn t really matter as long as you keep a save from the beginning of each day. The last chapter requires a certain amount of timing (as you re trying to stop an event that happens at a fixed time and everything you do advances the time in-game) but again unless you just keep one save file and repeatedly write over it you ll be fine. , April 21 2018, Eric the Unready was a comic text adventure (with graphics but the game is controlled with a parser) ; it s kind of a shame that the medium should have died off just as it was being perfected because games like this show how good text adventures could be,compton8369,a
Feist, The similarities to Limbo are just superficial. In the end it is a mix of 2D walking simulator rudimentary physics playground and fighting game with next to no puzzles. Even if you know what you are supposed to do it is a tedious chore and you can fail (or win) out of sheer (bad) luck. What irks me the most are the unavoidable fights especially the final boss which is just tedious and not fun at all. Having to face that monster head one without a possibility to really use the environment against him is bad design in this kind of game. There are long passages where nothing happens to artificially make the game a bit longer and it is still very short. The good things about this game are the graphics the audio designs technical stability (judging by the Linux port) and the fact that you can use any game-pad out of the box without having to deal with modern xinput restrictions.

The artwork stands out for its lushness while the music complements the atmosphere of the game well lending a dramatic quality. The game has some moments of humor mostly due to the doctor joking around with the odd cast of characters and there is a chance for romance. Some of the choices you make have obvious significance while with others it s not so clear what the consequences would be and there are so many threads between the characters that it would be hard to keep track of all the connections anyway.

Day Of The Tentacle Remastered, The game is a good remaster but the humor doesn t quite hold up. It can be beaten in a few hours and I felt that the voices for the NPCs were bad and corny like they got bad mimics of 1980 s looney tunes.

Ufo: Aftershock," TL;DR - great game but it s very difficult to play it on ANY intel video hardware. This is probably the best game of the series. Remember to download and install the ""unofficial"" patch - made by one of the devs. Bit boring if you play on very easy though. FOR ALL INTEL VIDEO CARD USERS - this game will NOT run on Intel hardware in Windows. Period. Even if you have a monster of an Intel Video card even if you have the latest and greatest drivers. Stop trying as the game is pretty much designed to fail when Intel drivers are detected. If you want to play it there is a way... To play on Intel video card you must use LINUX and WINE (Windows emulator running in Linux). The way I do it is: - run a virtual machine on my Windows laptop - install ubuntu on the virtual machine install WINE on ubuntu - copy all files related to the games from windows to the ubuntu machine - run the games from within ubuntu I can do it and I get roughly the same performance as I had back in the day.

Mother Russia Bleeds, Mother Russia Bleeds To start off most of the game is not about Russia being bad. In fact I say it s more of a mix states of china style with russia.

Oniken: Unstoppable Edition, A love letter to old NES-era games Oniken promises a hardcore experience where you WILL fail. However I found that that failure comes from poor design rather than any sort of actual challenge. A huge part of succeeding at Oniken is memorization knowing item enemy and hazard placement is mandatory if you want to complete a stage. And to beat the many bosses requires you spend time memorizing their attack patterns and when to be aggressive and when not to be. The problem with Oniken is that you pretty much have to know the level like the back of your hand taking any damage is damning and could potentially cost you a life due to how powerful the berserk power-up is. A power-up that could become inaccessible if you take damage as it requires two bars of your sword power-up of which you can have a maximum of three (two the first time you pick up the sword item and a third if you pick up another). It is possible to win without the berserk mode (I ve beaten the game without once using it) but again you must know the levels by heart. This leads to the second problem of Oniken the level design. Enemy and hazard placement can be at times sadistic there is a specific section in mission 5 where an enemy blocks your path while you are on a small moving platform. This enemy will block any attack until he lowers his shield at which point you have to feverishly mash the attack button in the hopes of taking him and his projectile in one go failure and you ll almost surely take damage and possibly fall off the platform. This type of enemy appears again in mission 6 again placed in a position that requires deft hands and button mashing to avoid any damage and hopefully reach the boss with berserk mode in hand. There s also the problem of hitboxes there are several times when a jump would fail the character s sprite clipping through the edge of a platform that should most definitely have been successful. As well as taking damage from touching enemies that barely scrapped the character and in some cases looked as if they had not even met. It s as if the character s is tiny when it comes to platforming but huge when it comes to taking a hit. There were also technical problems I relished the opportunity to use my arcade stick for another retro game but found that inputs would not register from button presses. This was a shock as my stick has been known to read inputs from just resting my fingers on top of the buttons I would need to slam down on the button just to go from a short hop to the proper jump I desired. All in all Oniken is a decent enough NES-esque game but the difficulty came from poor design and controls than actual well planned level and boss design. If your itching for another hardcore game to add to your belt and have the time and patience to spend grinding away at memorizing patterns this game could be for you. But if you lack the time or aren t willing to put up with poor controller support or several frustrating and admittedly cheap deaths you re better off just ringing your local Gamestop for a copy of Battletoads. , June 21 2018, A love letter to old NES-era games Oniken promises a hardcore experience where you WILL fail,farrell,a

Slain: Back From Hell," This game is hard and will take some practice to ""git good"" but at the end of the day it just feels tedious and repetitive. The levels all feel the same just with re-skinned enemies. The four weapons and magic types have the same issue; the differences between them are too slight to matter. There is only one attack ???combo??? you can do but it devolves into just mashing the attack button in the same three press pattern all the time. That being said the blocking dodging and countering system in this game does feel good and learning how to defend against the different enemies feels very rewarding. The visuals and music are both very good and they both play into a cohesive heavy metal theme. The rest of the game just seems to fall short there are no items to collect no secrets to find and no upgrades to choose. The levels are just a lot of flat surfaces to fight on but never become anything more than that. There are some ???traps??? that you have to avoid but all of them are so obvious that they become trivial especially since they never seem to be placed where combat takes place. There is just not enough variety in any part of this game to keep the player motivated and despite doing a few things well there isn t enough here to recommend it.

Shadows: Awakening," Let s begin with positives first it s a game it plays well with mid build PC and it has quite an interesting setting and story going for it possessing legendary warriors or goblin like creatures with little worth. And here starts the downfall the game is just a shell of an action role-playing hack and slash dungeon crawler game. Shadows: Awakening mechanic of traveling between ""spirit"" realm and ""living"" realm is one part that feels unfinished and is draging the game in to the depths (and makes it harder to find what you need to do and where you need to go). Biggest problem of the game are the controls themselves they felt like I was playing a game from the early 2000s... run away hit couple of spells run again hit some spells and wait till you ve more mana and repeat (atleast in boss fights). Skills felt like they were lacking power. When I m playing game about legends I m expecting some powerful spells skills etc. I don t want to bash the developers I can feel how they cared about this game and wanted to give it their all but they should have spend more time in the drawing board.

Cry as your liquid disappears offscreen which you could do nothing about and thus lost forever. Weep as you fail the level right before the end due to this constantly happening. Isn t it fun when physics apply to your character(?) to such an extent that you don t feel like you have proper control? You would think so but sadly when I actually played it I disagreed.

Gomo, Gomo seems to be a game that relies solely on its visuals considering each puzzle only takes you at most a minute to solve and some only a few seconds. Sadly that visual style isn t very appealing at least to me and everything you see in this game feels thrown together. From the type of puzzles you re tasked with solving to what s on the screen to the puzzleslack of difficulty. Everything feels as if not a lot of effort went into it nor a lot of thought. There is a premise to the game but most of the puzzles you solve and the screens you re going to visit have nothing to do with that premise. All this game consists of is going to a new screen picking up the one item you can pick up using it on the one thing you can use it on go to the next screen rinse and repeat. Gomo isn t atrocious by any means but it s so lacking in effort that playing it you wonder why you even bother. It does try to be humorous but the humor is so bad I didn t even chuckle. The most hard hitting gag this game seems to have is showing a sheep floating midair tied to a balloon. Gomo just feels like the type of game one guy makes on his own time releasing it for free.

A Fistful Of Gun, A fistful of gun is a single or co-op top down shooter with a unique gimmick in which every character has their own shooting method. Some characters has a typical mouse-keyboard controls (mouse to aim left click to shoot right click for various things) some has directional controls (WSAD and IJKL or shift and control). Although it says a gamepad is required there are alternate controls in all of the characters so you can get away with just playing with a keyboard and mouse. There are several game modes to play Arena Story and Versus. My disclaimer: I only played single player - I have not ever experienced the co-op. Overall it was a bit mediocre. Each character plays differently and is imbalanced (purposely?) by its control methods and its unique characteristics. For instance if you play Billy you can only shoot if you follow the pattern given in the gun indicator (i.e you alternate between IJKL to shoot) while in other characters you just click the left mouse button. Likewise you can aim with the mouse in some characters but on others you have to face the target. Also most characters is a one hit one kill system but one character you play as a brigade so you can take multiple hits in exchange to firepower. What I did not like unfortunately was the music. Not that it wasn t good (as taste is subjective personally I didn t particularly like it) it just wasn t western. I was expecting some music that made me feel like I was in well the lawless western. It didn t. Overall I think this is a game where you would just play it in small periods.

This is something of a Walking Simulator however the pace is much faster than your regular Dear Ester ripoff and it is much more about immersion rather than fear factor (Amnesia). There is no combat.

However there is a moment where you meet two siblings that are actively mocking you and trying to catch you where I was not regretting my purchase. It was excellent.

Pizza Connection 3," Pizza Connection 2 war schon immer eines meiner liebsten Spiele. Daher habe ich mich sehr gefreut diesen Teil hier spielen zu k??nnen. Leider konnte ich nicht viel davon spielen da: 1. Die Performance unglaublich schlecht ist. Sowohl an Macs (verst??ndlich) als auch an Windows-Ger??ten. Nun kann es sein dass mein PC einfach sehr alt ist dennoch musste ich die Aufl??sung ziemlich verringern damit das Spiel auf niedrigster grafischer Aufl??sung fl??ssig l??uft. 2. Das freie Spiel ist absolut unspielbar dank eines Bugs. Sobald das Spiel gestartet wird ruckelt die Kamera sehr schnell von links nach rechts. Das macht es unm??glich das Spiel zu spielen. In den seltenen F??llen dass dieser Fehler nicht auftritt ist aber ein zweiter ziemlich unangenehmer Bug versteckt. 3. Der gerade unter Punkt 2 erw??hnte Bug ist nicht so zerst??rerisch. Dabei werden ""lediglich"" die Texturen von gekauften Objekten wie Tischen oder St??hlen schnell abwechselnd dargestellt. Ab und an bekommen diese zus??tzlich ein grelles Leuchten. Ein wenig Musik im Hintergrund und man hat tats??chlich das Gef??hl in einer Disko zu sein. Das positive ist dennoch eine Erw??hnung wert. Der Humor der damaligen Teile wurde auf jeden Fall beibehalten. Es gibt immer noch komplex zusammenh??ngende Statistiken und Vorkommnisse. Es gibt sechs verschiedene Zielgruppen die unterschiedliche Vorlieben haben was den Belag der Pizzen angeht und diese Vorlieben unterscheiden sich auch noch einmal von Stadt zu Stadt.

Stories Untold, --Really good storytelling combined with a good story and well achieved atmosphere and the fact that is told in short stories made this a must for me.-- I loved to read a good book since elementary school but the thing I always liked more than a good novel is a good short story. Books are great for short stories (Poe Stephen King etc) and the only other media I enjoyed them was TV series (Twilight Zone and similar). So any time I see short stories in other media I jump right to them but videogames have been really dry in short story territory. Today it seems more indies are trying to go there and this is a good example on how to do it. The game is comprised of 4 stories but the last one is a tie-in for the other 3. Spoilers the first stories are linked but that s not clear until the last one in which they give a sort of explanation. Anyway I really like this game I enoyed the stories a lot (except for the 3rd one) and it helped me to scratch that itch. The stories are pretty well written and the first one is specially chilling. I think they did a great job with the atmosphere and with how they comunicated what they wanted. I can t really say anything for other aspects of the game I think graphics and sound are pretty well done but I usually don t pay attention to that. The only reason I give it a 4 is because the 3rd chapter. The microfilm was too  microand my TV didn t display it that well so I needed to check online for what was I m supposed to read on the microfilm and that meant using a guide for almost all the chapter. In the end I find it with some flaws but really enjoyable nonetheless. , April 23 2018, --Really good storytelling combined with a good story and well achieved atmosphere and the fact that is told in short stories made this a must for me,wilkins4347,a
Circle Empires," Really was looking for a quick RTS fix. Love the whole Idea.

Mulaka, In Mulaka spielt man einen Krieger einen Schamanen der mit Unterst??tzung von Natur und ??bernat??rlichen sowie feiner Hack&amp;Slay oder anderen Movies wie Speerwurf oder Feuerbomben werfen auf Reise geht um die Welt vom B??sen zu befreien ... ... scheint nicht tiefsinnig typisch ??ktschn. Die Story aber ist tiefgehend inspiriert von den als Langstreckenl??ufer bekannten in Nord Mexico ans??ssigen indigenen Volk der Tarahumara und vermittelt viel Wissen was man gerne aufsaugt. Das Spiel kommt ohne Synchronstimmen aus der Text ist ??bersichtlich und nicht zuviel die Zwischensequenzen bestehen aus sehr sch??nen Bildern und Geschichte in Text. Das Gameplay ist gut aber nicht top: die Kamera muss immer manuell eingestellt werden was in hektischen Situtionen nicht immer klappt. Der Charakter verbleibt bei erfolgten Kombos in einer kurzen millisekunden langer Starre was oftmals einen gegnerischen Treffer zufolge hat sofern mehr als zwei Gegner einen umkreisen. Das treffen von fliegenden Gegnern mit dem Speer erweist sich als schwer. Das Genre merkt man Mulaka aber trotzdem gut an man ist schnell drin besonders als Genre Fan und es macht Spa?? den Gegnern kostenfreie Nackenschl??ge zu geben. Die Bossfights sind spa??ig teils fordernd aber sp??ter auch gern hektisch.

LicHDom: Battlemage, There s many good things about this game. It s very linear but this can be delt with if the base game is good. Sadly it s not. For a game boasting about being entirely focused on magic it does nothing with it. This is mainly because of the crafting system that the implemented in the game. Although you would think that its not a terrible idea at first by time you get to the second boss you will relise it absolutly destories this game. At the very start your attacks are missle lobbed bomb and ray for your main attack and thats it you ll never get any other attack that could be remotely interesting. Aside from your main attack you get an aoe attack and a block. These have no varriation on how the attack effect is like your main attack Even the diffrent types of elements you use can not make up for this. from the very start you get fire which is the best combat type meaning theres litterly no reason to use any other besides to make your fire spell more effective (even though it will kill everyone besides bosses and upgraded enemies easily). Then you have the mixed spells. Whenever I relized that this existed I was ecstatic I thought that this game might not actully be a waste of my money. but even this mechanic is heavily flawed. First off it takes wayyyyyyyy to long to get to this point. (about 4-6 hours) and the pat off is not worth it. In total there are 12 mixed spells. THERE IS ONLY 12 IN A GAME 100% FOCUSED ON BADASS MAGIC. They are also rather generic and uninspired. IMO if you re going to release a game thats based on magic go wild with your imagination. Most people who would buy the game are those who have an itch for magic in games and have already used these basic spells in countless games and they want to see new interesting things. Not a game based around the same 3 generic spells. Lichdom is possibly a good game if they never went with the poorly designed crafting system. , August 3 2018, There s many good things about this game,valentine7194,a

D: The Game, First and foremost: If you didn t play and enjoy this game back when it came out it is not worth picking up now. It s ugly the sound design is terrible it s boring and the plot is utterly stupid. I m sure it was groundbreaking when it was first released but for a horror fan that is just discovering this game it s not worth it.

Unrest," You are a peasant girl told to marry a jerk or die. Do you do what you are told (and live) mouth off (die) or run away (probably die)? Choose carefully because your answer will affect... well actually not all that much. You see no matter what you choose this game s structure isn t really built to handle all the ramifications of what you choose in a scenario and so it s sort of like your choices in KoToR 1 being moot in KoToR 2 because you visit none of the same places and the galaxy is in just as much a state of turmoil no matter whether you went Light Side or Dark Side. You play as several characters but only one actually returns to more than one chapter and the resolution of all the other character s plots don t actually change anything but a few text blurbs or maybe a cameo appearance. In each chapter there s basically one BIG choice and a handful of others that are more window dressing or a lead-up to what you do in your big choice. Hence the whole of the game really comes down to about three or four choices and the rest is window dressing. It s frankly a failing of scripting and the fact that a limited team just plain can t offer the ""real choices with real consequences"" in a manually scripted setting because they can t handle manually writing out all the permutations of their choices. This is the sort of game that really needs to incorporate emergent or procedural gameplay elements to carry out its promise but this is obviously a hand-crafted linear narrative storytelling experience that s trying to break out of the linearity and only partially succeeding. Play-wise it s more point-and-click and visual novel than RPG. Basically imagine if BioWare stopped including combat in their games and had a couple inventory puzzles instead. In the end this is just more proof of why choice in games comes down to either hollow choices in linear storytelling or sandboxes with no written narrative.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Kingdom come feels like a game still in beta. The game itself is playable but there are still a lot of bugs even at v1.7. Combat system needs a lot of improvement. It doesn t have to be necessarily hard where players can t enjoy it. Response time is horrible. Auto lock is BS especially in uneven terrain. Using the bow is downright stupid. It s like my character is a 5 year old trying to pull a bow. Isn t Henry supposed to be the son of a blacksmith hammering all day getting strong? Shit don t make sense.

Sine Mora Ex, Despite I got all the achievements and beat all the challenges I did not enjoy this game too much myself. I wanted and tried really hard to love or at least appreciate this game but whenever i was having some fun it ended up being ruined by it s few but glaring issues. It might take too long to make a detailed review so i ll do a small list of pros and cons instead: Pros: -Amazing visuals and designs. Among the best i ever seen -Controls fine. If you play with a controller it works pretty well -Good and well fitting music. There is a bit of everything and everything has the right tone -Deep (and dark) story. A father chasing revenge and the last remnants of a civilization against an empire -Interesting mechanics. Your biggest enemy is the time which you can also manipulate. Cons: -Unclear hitboxes. Blandly shown in the plane selection screen -Bad implementation of the 3-D environments and visual effects. Is often unclear what s in the background and what s in the foreground. Sometimes the visual effects and foreground objects also obstruct your view of units and projectiles -Bad projectiles display. Some enemy attacks blend with the environment or even theyr own visual effects -Inconsistent damage. some things just hit you some other destroy you istantly with no indication -Terrible telegraphing. at first you will die a lot just for not knowing what s coming -Unclear scoring system. score multiplier and stage score are calculated differently -Bad visual and control customization. No windowed mode and arcade sticks work the same as the gamepad. -Terrible multiplayer. Why can t both players have a plane ? So should you buy this game ? If you are not big time into shmups and just want one to pickup and play you ll enjoy this one for sure. If you are a lot into this kind of game just forget about it the way is designed goes against any logic for both shmup and danmaku.

Oddworld: Stranger S Wrath HD," I got through the game I am mostly satisfied and it has so many interesting aspects and beauties to it that I can overlook the flaws - mostly If you like FPS and are okay with different mechanics than ""shoot enemy in head move on to next"" than this is a wonderful game for you. My mature down points were: 1) I was expecting an open world I guess from the screen shots. It is partly open but mostly strictly linear in its levels. You can approach your targets different ways though most of the time so you have some freedom how to proceed. (Stealth only works partially though) 2) From the screenshots i got the impression that you will fly with a kite or something ingame. That s not there. its a mine cart where I interpreted to much into surrounding architecture. 3) The game changes pace - and somehow also style - about halfway through quite a lot. The ""do it your way take your time"" approach gets partly replaced by pressure to proceed. 4) On hard some aspects of the game are harder than others. You have the option to take people alive and on hard especially bosses are very hard to get alive its much easier to kill them. That took some fun out of me and even amde me have a major break in my playthrough. 5) I still don t understand the ending. Maybe you have better luck ;-) All in all even though it has downsides it is worth the five stars because of the experiments and creativity in style weapons setting etc. that other FPS lack.

Fossil Echo, FOSSIL ECHO is more an interactive cartoon than a platformer. Graphics animations music are good but you ll spend more time as a spectator than as a player. Your character wakes up then you move right : animation. You approach another character : animation. Then you enter a door : animation. The platform phases are... the exact term is : boring. It s repetitive and finally not rewarding. The difficulty is medium and depends exclusively on the timing. Generally you have no second chance when you fail - some elements disappear and you have to kill yourself... The stealth phases are equally boring the pace isn t mastered.

Rune Classic," This game is made by it s combat ""system"" - if it can be called that- and multiplayer. It has the baseline ""feel"" of an FPS (specifically Unreal) - no wonder since it s made in the UnrealEngine* - but is played in third person. Whilst it might sound like it this is not a bad thing; on the contrary it makes it feel very tight and precisely controlled. The combat is where this game shines. With such tight controls running jumping and swinging around just feels incredible. It s tight it s fast-paced and it s - above all - precise. The controls are also exceptionally simple; one button to swing one to block and... That s about it. Ok technically there is also a button to throw your currently equipped weapon and one to activate your weapons powerup but that s it. That might sound weird but it is a third-person melee-based game that essentially runs like a first-person shooter. It runs on FPS sensibilities; weapons and powerups are placed around the maps you spawn with one not very good weapon and have to run around picking stuff up to increase your arsenal. For those that might have played it it essentially plays like Quake III Arena in the multiplayer. At a higher level map-awareness is key but individual combat-skill wins the day. The combat is visceral fast-paced and feels excellently ""heavy"". Various weapons have various properties; e.g. mace-type weapons are excellent for smashing shields whereas swords not so much. Every weapon has it s own unique powerup mode as well; this can be activated by way of finding ""rune power-stones"" that are scattered about the map (this is essentially ""mana""). A fun little detail is that you can also dismember players specifically chop off their arms and head; you can then pick up these body-parts and use them as weapons. They are not particularly good as weapons go and doesn t have any special powerups but it s a nice little touch. It is still possible to play multiplayer online; there are a few small communities dedicated to the MP part of this game and it s easy to why; it is still to this day quite unique as far as third-person hack-and-slashers go at least from an engine/""feel""-perspective and the MP is excellently realized with several interesting modes (one interesting mode in particular is essentially football except that you have to chop off body-parts from members of the opposing team pick them up and throw them into the goal). Now you might be asking yourself ""well this sounds fun but this isn t a multiplayer-only game it s got a singleplayer campaign as well what about that?"". Well that s the thing - it s mediocre. Not incredibly bad mind; some of the environments are quite immersive and well-crafted and there are a few nice moments here and there but by and large the SP campaign is nothing special. It s very much a child of it s time with a Viking aesthetic thrown over it; nothing particularly bad but nothing particularly gripping either. The expansion Halls of Valhalla actually only adds weapons and maps to the MP-component of the game and does nothing to the SP. So do try the SP-campaign as it might be a fun few hours for you but chances are if you stay you stay for the MP. *And a general tip; out on the net you ll be able to find loads of new renderers for it; DX9 DX10 a Vulkan one wouldn t surprise me updated OpenGL ones everything (and they can add everything from true AA to new lightning-subsystems); the old UnrealEngines have a rather heavy developer-community based around them and so you can find a lot of stuff related to them.

Baldur S Gate II: Enhanced Edition, http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/1135-disable-enhanced-edition-npcs/ The above link is to a mod by Argent77 which will disable the new companions. Baldur s gate is one of the best CRPGs ever made and the Enhanced edition adds excellent technical improvements. These updates add a range of options for tailoring your experience and in most ways improves the experience. The GOG release also includes the original version. If you are at all a fan of RPGs then do yourself the favour of getting this game. Unfortunately Beamdog the programmers of the enhanced edition saw fit to not only improve the technical aspects of the game but also add their own characters. These characters should have been offered in a separate content pack DLC but instead Beamdog made them a permanent part of the game. The new characters are hard to miss and attempt to take a front seat. Gamers new to Baldur s Gate can be forgiven for thinking that these are the primary companions. It seems that Beamdog tried to piggy-back off Baldur s Gate s success by inserting their own creations which is a fairly hubristic action. Luckily they have learned from their mistake and there are no such intrusive changes made to later Enhanced Edition games; Planescape Torment EE Icewind Dale EE etc. Unfortunately Beamdog have not decided to remove the new Baldur s Gate characters and put them in a seperate content pack DLC.

Deathtrap, Deathtrap was a minigame that showed up a few times in Van Helsing 3 and Van Helsing: Final Cut by the same developers. Deathtrap is a Tower Defense game where you walk around attacking things yourself. Mechanics here were slightly changed to fit the genre better different skill trees but is it enough? Deathtrap has 13 maps around 10 hours. Lots more to do after redoing maps on higher difficulties. I have no interest in doing so. The game has plenty of towers available; you can reset the skill trees for both the towers and your character by paying gold it s fine. Having to buy potions seemed weird and less fine.

Milanoir, A dark and gritty 70 s style crime story is marred by poor controls. The problem is the player -- whether on foot or in a vehicle -- seems to have poor footing. While forgivable in a vehicle for a game very dependent on cover shooting Piero s lack of any ability to actually stick to cover sticks out like a sore thumb. This is compounded by the fact that his movement doesn t seem natural -- he seems to move too quickly for the speed of his animation and when trying to take evasive action he feels completely out of control. You might want to duck behind cover but instead he rolls. If in a stationary position via holding SPACE and he may/may not roll even while mashing movement keys repeatedly. The only thing that seems sure is that if you re moving about he WILL roll. Making matters worse is the inability to remap anything which is pretty poor for any PC game. There is stealth in the game but it s extremely primitive. The only noise made seems to be dependent on firing a gun. Line of sight isn t always clear; thankfully there s only one stealth mission and it s short. The biggest letdown is the final sections of the game which lack much in the way of clever tricks to break up the monotony of what becomes pure run-and-gun with little opportunity for stealth or tactics. The game starts very strong too all the more the pity. Story-wise it s dark and gritty. If that s not your cup of tea give the game a miss. If you enjoy a grim tale of betrayal and lies without any heroes... then it s worth watching. Overall not a bad game but not one that would keep me coming back. , June 7 2018, A dark and gritty 70 s style crime story is marred by poor controls,santiago7903,a
Hacknet, (Below is a reprint of my original review of  Hackneton Steam. I love the game so much that I purchased another copy on GOG just for the DRM-free version.) In  Hacknetyou play as a computer user who has just been bestowed a unique operating system (OS) with tools that can hack different computers. As the game progresses you will discover new hacking tools join other factions of hackers fulfill hacking job contracts to build your reputation and solve the game???s central mystery. What I love about  Hacknetis the high level of immersion and engaging pacing. With my headphones on listening to the adrenaline-pumping soundtrack I voraciously took on one hacking contract after another. Before long two to three hours have flown by. The game s missions though all require hacking vary in objects and pacing. Because of that I did not find gameplay repetitive and I used every opportunity to familiarize myself with the tools I had at my disposal. All of this prepared me for the climatic final mission which totally did not disappoint.  Hacknetis novice-friendly but some players may find it having a slightly steep learning curve. Players will be at an advantage if they can type fast has used *nix (e.g. Linux) shell commands and/or are familiar with text-based OSes. This is because the user interface of Hacknet is austere with typing as your primary form of input. Still there are simple graphics to depict hacking progress network of computers and directory trees. You can use your mouse from time to time as means of in-game navigation as I did.  Hacknet  s appeal aside from immersion and pacing is really its simplicity. The players will always be given all the tools they would need to complete missions. So the real challenge is to figure out which tool(s) to use to hack the computers and phones and to do it quickly and efficiently. So think fast! Type fast and furious! Once the dust has settled snooping around the hacked machines and reaping your rewards are gratifying. At the time of this review  Hacknetis my favourite hacking-themed game. It???s fast it???s empowering and it???s extremely gratifying -- especially after a challenging mission. I highly recommend this game to those who wish an adrenaline-pumping brain-teasing text-based adventure game. , September 17 2018, (Below is a reprint of my original review of  Hackneton Steam,kennedy,a
Hypergun," Meh I have about 5-7 hours playtime and I feel I have a decent ""feel"" for the game and the content presented so I d say that for the intial asking price of $14.99 its kind of a hard sell. I tend to agree with the previous review: the content is a little sparse hopefully thhat changes with updates but what we have here is a little barren but as a quick time sink it can be pretty enjoyable in short bursts. The shooting mechanics are well servicable and the graphical options are fairly decent for a game developed in the Unity engine. The obvious star of the show here is the OST which is very good and suits the games art style. Other sounds are rather bland almost completely not even worth noting. On a side not I d like to see maybe some procedural generation applied to the bosses as well as fighting the same boss at the end of the same level over and over again can really feel tedious and makes me second guess another run from time to time. If this whole package were available for an intial price of say $9.99 then most of the gripes could be absolved because of the cheaper asking price. At 15 bucks? The barren content for this price starts to come to the forefront a bit more. I d wait for a sale wait for some updates maybe.

Frozen Cortex, I m not much of a fan of sports games but this one really piqued my interest. However from the start there were numerous bugs and problems that had to be worked through. The tutorial is vague on some instructions making it very hard to progress and doesn t explain a lot of the rules of the game. For instance the tutorial does not tell you that you can ONLY pass the ball immediately after picking it up or receiving it. If you move once you have the ball you have to run it. While it mentions running the ball as an option it never states that it s your only option once you move. Between the lack of information provided in the tutorial and other little bugs that severely affect the nuance of this game I am unimpressed and disappointed. It can be fun to watch but not so much when struggling to play with a genre I m not overly familiar with and random bugs and unexplained rules. , August 22 2016, I m not much of a fan of sports games but this one really piqued my interest,bates,a

Rogue Trooper, Rogue Trooper is a game based on the comic by the same name. One of the main drawing factors for me and one of the main reasons as to why I always wanted to play this game was specifically because of it???s universe the characters the animals the places the colors the entire thing. In this regard the game delivers by even having your backpack helmet and weapon be characters of their own with their own unique personalities it???s really fun although sometimes their comments can get a bit annoying (specially the one???s from the gun) it???s all relative I guess. The real fun as you might have come to expect really comes from the gameplay and some of the ideas that are being used in correlation with the narrative and as I said with the whole concept of your equipment being ???alive??? to a degree. You can craft ammo as well as different upgrades for your weapons then after finishing the game you can use everything you???ve previously unlock with only your main game progression being the one that gets reset it???s a new game plus of some kind. Really the biggest problems of the game lie with how some of the mechanics of the game haven???t aged that well to not say they were a bit ???archaic??? even by the time they were released. The game adds a massive amount of recoil to your main fire-mode which it???s the one you will be using for the most part it???s fun and it works fairly well in cover until you actually start running around strafing and shooting all at once that???s when out of nowhere the game starts to become a bit bizarre with how it handles it???s gunplay and shooting mechanics. Instead of respecting the general rule of recoil that if not applies in real life then at the very least in games having your weapon tilting backwards or upwards after each shot the game handles this strangely by sometimes behaving erratically and having you only be able to get certain shots while aiming a bit higher up to a point where at times it???s ???off-target??? for the most part trying to be as accurate as you can be with your shoots can simply land you in a position in which most of them don???t really feel they???re doing anything at all so if not for ineffectiveness then at the very least for overall ???feel??? the game fails at this being something as important that it???s part of the main game???s core mechanics paired with the fact that it is something that you???ll have to use further into the game as everything gets progressively ???harder??? it is a pretty massive issue. Pair that up with the fact that the cover system in this game feels strange and for the most part doesn???t work very well at times my character wouldn???t take cover other times it would other times while in cover it would all of the sudden ???snap??? out of it. It???s just bad that the game relies so much in a system that it???s fundamentally flawed in so many levels. Then you have the other aspect of the game which gives the player a series of upgrades to choose from ranging from different fire-modes that in reality turn your weapon into a different one (shotgun rocket launcher sniper rifle etc???) The idea here it???s to have the player using all of this different weapons in a series of different cases problem being that often times you???ll simply rely on just using the main fire-mode that being the sub-machinegun one whilst other times you???ll simply find yourself getting caught up in the heat of the battle (so to speak) not being able to switch quickly enough to other fire-mode in time getting killed and having to restart once again that particular area. It???s frustrating to say the least. To give another example there???s one point in the game where the game starts trying to implement a whole ???stealth??? system it???s fairly basic you can rely in attracting enemies sneaking behind them and ???taking them out??? with your knife or simply by adding a silencer to your weapon (which by the way prompts said weapon to say some pretty hilarious lines of dialog). The whole mission it???s structured in a way at the very least in concept to warn you that an immediate ???alert??? will result in the ???termination??? of the mission. Saddest thing is eventually after a while you???re prompted to ???blow up??? a particular area after doing so whatever shred of ???stealth??? there was in concept or in gameplay was then nonexistent. Even then what I do need to say it???s that the game managed to somehow??? Captivate me with it???s ideas it???s characters and as I said it???s universe it???s a wonderful game in that sense and that???s personally the reason why I think it has become such a ???cult??? classic today. I recommend to get it on a deep sale while at the same time understanding that what you???re getting into it???s a fairly old game and it shows sadly through some aspects of it???s gameplay. Now I???m simply just to interested in seeing what will happen with the new remaster edition coming later this year or well??? In a couple of weeks. Either way nice that I finally got to play been wanting to play it ever since the game had come out while being a kid it was as if the stars align to prevent me from playing it. Maybe it was better that way. , September 26 2017, Rogue Trooper is a game based on the comic by the same name,ware,a
Shenzhen I/O," A very hard game intended only for programmer and engineering minded players. Think before buying as the game is incredibly hard. On the other hand it is incredibly satisfying to master as well. Shenzhen IO nominally provides 30 puzzles to be solved (plus an extra campaign of about 10 puzzles). However there is more than meets the eye. Solving the puzzles is hard and solving the puzzles efficiently is even harder (and there are histograms comparing every submitted solution). Creating the best solutions (and if you like the game you ll want to) can increase the play time by an order of magnitude. I have been at it for about a year (occasionally firing it up to solve a problem) and I ve yet managed to do about 70% of the puzzles with optimal solutions. The game is good both for ""casual"" play (casual still being incredibly hard but focusing on advancing the story) and for obsessive ""gotta-catch-them-all"" style going for optimal solutions. Besides there is a sandbox mode in which you can simulate any device you want. There have been many wonderful projects done in the sandbox with videos in Youtube. It s wonder that gives and keeps giving. 4 1/2 stars. ", September 27 2018, A very hard game intended only for programmer and engineering minded players,dorsey,a
Full Throttle Remastered, The game is of course still terrific and atmospheric. Having discovered it with the remake I loved it. But the redrawn assets lack some of the original detail.

Owlboy, Just like Boyhood it took 10 years to make! so it must be good right? Wrong. I ran into a bug at the beginning of the game that forced me to backtrack for an hour only to realize that all I could do was revert to a previous checkpoint. Combat is deceptively simple for seasoned veterans of hardcore platformers but will leave noobies in frustration due to its muddled and cumbersome mechanics. No one is satisfied so who was this game made for? The story starts off on a very wrong note regardless of what message the developers wanted to send and continues to chug along not something worth sticking around for. The art and the soundtrack are great but that s not anywhere near enough to make up for the terrible combat and mediocre story. DIssapointing seeing as the game misrepresents itself as a light nostalgia trip with Zelda-esque qualities. Instead it s just a disappointing mess. , October 28 2018, Just like Boyhood it took 10 years to make! so it must be good right? Wrong,freeman7664,a
Olliolli, I d equate OlliOlli to all those cellphone runner games where you go down a path and avoid obstacles. Only this time instead of running you re on a skateboard. Meaning OlliOlli isn t a true skateboarding game. Tricks are easy to perform and require no knowledge whatsoever - only buttom mashing. There s no difference in difficulty (at least using a keyboard) between an ollie and a salad grind or a 360 flip. So there s no fun in landing a difficult trick. Levels are also fairly repetitive - each level seems to consist of a series of grindable surfaces with very little flat ground in between. So most of the time you ll just jump from grindable surface to grindable surface throwing a flip in between with maybe a 180 or 360 spin for some extra points. To make the levels last longer you re given a series of things to do in each level - collect a certain number of points overall string tricks together to reach a certain number of points grind certain surfaces or collect items scattered throughout the level. It does turn each level from a level you d spend a few minutes in to a level you might spend an hour in just to complete each task. But the problem with that is that each level seems to have almost the same exact challenges. There s just very little one can do in a sidescrolling skateboard game. And a lot of those challenges are easy to complete since you don t need to complete them all at once. Most of them you don t even need to finish the level to complete. If you need to perform a certain trick you can do it at the start of a level not finish the level and it d still count. A difficulty setting would have been nice. The game seems to also suffer from some minor bugs from time to time - like the game not registering key presses sometimes and not even registering me pressing a button with the mouse. And from time to time the game would suffer a slowdown at the start of a level usually making me wipeout. But maybe that only happens to me. , July 18 2018, I d equate OlliOlli to all those cellphone runner games where you go down a path and avoid obstacles,koch,a

Detective Gallo," Here is our noir gritty detective...who is a chicken and has a partner who is a cacti and he tries to resolve the murder of...plants. Sounds hillarious right? I mean this is some monkey Island level of absurd fun right? Well...no. Because the tone is jarring. Our character is dead serious for him this is just a normal world he does not acknowledge how riddicolous this whole premise is. And since we kind of are our character we also start to treat this like normal everyday world. We meet quirky characters who are never acknowledged as quirky so we kind of assume that this is normal in this world. Maybe this is a matter of taste but I love absurd Sam&amp;Max is my favourite series and you can hardly get more absurd than that but in this game joke becomes tired very quickly. When you take away the absurd (and you quickly will trust me humans can adapt to anything) story becomes your run of the mill noir detective murder story. So what about gameplay? Puzzles are not really puzzles this is once again ""Use the plank on a tree so tree will speak to you and give you an acorn which you will trade for pizza and throw a pizza to distract the guard"" adventure game cliche. I feel bad about reviewing this game since a lot of this is about personal taste I mean maybe you will laught your face of... but let me warn you it is a paint by numbers adventure game without any kind of logical puzzles and typical inventory ""use everything on everything and hope that it sticks"" except in this case it won t since you not only have to use correct item on correct hotspot but also do it in correct moment if you have not talked to X do not even try to do Y cause it won t work. I will not talk about graphics or music since you can see it. I bought the game because it sounds like so much fun everything promises you quirky adventure but it is a lie. It is just typical murder story with strange graphics. My advice? Wait for sale and see for yourself but no need to rush things. ", August 13 2018, Here is our noir gritty detective,castro1378,a

Finding Paradise," This game is like it s predecessor ""To the Moon"" a moving emotional experience presented as an interactive narrative with relatively little standard gameplay experience. Like in ""To the Moon"" you take control of two employees of the Sigmund Corporation and are tasked with granting a dying man (first seen in ""A Bird Story"") his last wish -- at least through his memories. This leads you to explore different stages in this man s life and his development from a lonely youth to an airline pilot. As you figure out his numerous regrets you realize something that challenges what you know about your job. Overall the story is not as strong as that of ""To the Moon"" but it is certainly enough to give your heart strings a pull. Make sure to complete the game in one sitting (average time: 4 hours) to get the complete emotional effect. A lot of reviews have argued that the lack of interactive gameplay is a big flaw in this game. This is indeed more of an interactive novel and walking simulator than a ""gamer s game"". Yes there are puzzles that need to be solved before moving to different stages in the patient s life and there are scenes that implement shooting fighting and RPG-fighting mechanics but those take up less than 15% of the total play time (average: 4 hours). If you seek solely a gameplay experience it might be best to avoid ""Finding Paradise"". However if you seek a great narrative that tugs at your heart strings while at times making you laugh with its self-awareness this is well worth the price.

Drod Rpg: Tendry S Tale, DROD is a long-running franchise of puzzle games sadly very underrated but in 2008 Caravel Games decided to try something a little bit different. Still set in the same universe as the other games DROD RPG takes a few steps away from regular puzzlers. Your task is to guide Tendry a brave soldier through several levels (12 plus a secret stage each consisting of about 20-30 rooms or more). It s still very much a puzzle game but apart from collecting keys (different kinds open different doors so you ll have to think twice before using them) you ll also need to fight all sorts of enemies (humans and monsters alike) collect money (by fighting said enemies) and get more powerful to be able to survive. While still not an RPG despite its title the game now has objects you can use (some only once some more than once) and you can raise (or level if you wanna stick to RPG terms) your HP armor and defense to make things easier. The top-down perspective and the mini-map makes it easy to get an overview of the levels and think up a grand strategy but sometimes you ll need to try different approaches to certain problems. No matter how tempting it is to kill everything as soon as you see them it s a bad idea. Wait till you get stronger/more powerful and in the meantime try to think of alternate solutions like bypassing doors going round enemies without initiating a fight (which is turn-based by the way) and so on. Be sure to save as often as possible though because it s easy to run into dead ends sometimes. Normally this would make me irritated and admittedly this game had the same effect on me initially but after I realized my mistakes (not using items/keys optimally starting fights with monsters left and right since  Hey there s a health potion right there why should I care?not looking for secret areas etc.) I started over and had a much more fulfilling experience. And despite it being a long game (relatively speaking but when you think it s over after a few hours it turns out it s only the end of the first half) replaying certain areas with a more thought-out strategy doesn t take very long at all. The game is a huge amount of fun very easy to pick up and pretty hard to put down. Just one more room... (It also has some references to other titles in the series but you ll be fine playing it without any prior knowledge.) Pros: - Takes a while to complete (~8 hours or more) - Save anywhere (you ll need it!) - Active community on the game s website - Replayability (try for a higher score look for secret areas or alternate solutions download user-made levels etc.) Cons: - A little bit on the trial-and-error side and sometimes the error part only becomes evident later so save often - The voice acting is pretty poor though after a while I found at least the main charcter s voice more funny than annoying , December 22 2015, DROD is a long-running franchise of puzzle games sadly very underrated but in 2008 Caravel Games decided to try something a little bit different,shields3168,a
Faces Of War, The Idea of this game is pretty good. Graphics look nice and physics are awesome. But here are the negative points: Poor/weird camera to many buttons and controls (hell this is just overloaded! Less and more intuitive would be better) to much of trial and error (for example because of the weird camera) game mechanics are broken sometimes (you know it when you play it) sometimes you have absolutly no idea what youre supposed to do now :D Ok for this low price it is ok and if you have enough patience to replay every mission 3-4 times because you f*** up with the camera or just the controls and your squad is wiped out then youre ok with this on.

Battlezone 98 Redux, Lost a star due to uncompetitive price on GoG. For those who ve played the original game(s): If you enjoyed Battlezone  98 you ll enjoy the redux. They ve been very faithful to the original mostly focusing on modernising and optimising the engine as opposed to revamping the whole game. This does mean a couple complaints I ve had since the 90s are still there: - Controls will feel very wonky until you ve adjusted sensitivity to your liking. Never hugely liked the momentum on turns even if it does help differentiate your units. - Controls are also very early-3D style. You ve got WASD but you ve also got oddities like E for jump and Space for use as default. - Some controls are also not included in the options menu such as I for Info. It s included in the tutorials and early missions but it s still an oversight. - Bad pathfinding and AI in general - Lack of command options (e.g. no Attack Move) - An occasionally stupidly high difficulty curve. For those who haven t played the original: Do you like RTS? Do you like FPS? Do you enjoy campy sci-fi stories about alien metals and the Cold War? Do you like games such as Savage or Nuclear Dawn which combine genres into new games? You ll probably love Battlezone then. It s clunky it s campy (a plus for me) but the core gameplay is solidly enjoyable and the story keeps you interested enough to try the next mission assuming the prospect of blowing up more space tanks doesn t already do that. Graphically speaking it s competent by modern standards with nicely revamped textures models terrain and particle effects. Audio s a bit hit and miss in terms of VA but otherwise good enough. The gameplay is the biggest adjustment for most but once you ve done the 10 min odd tutorial and played the first mission or two it feels quite natural. A flawed classic but a classic nonetheless. I ve picked up Combat Commander too which I never played the original of. More of the same but now with actual aliens. , March 7 2018, Lost a star due to uncompetitive price on GoG,merritt,a

Lilly Looking Through, This game does not support AMD Radeon 7700 graphics card which was not stated in the storefront page. As this is a rather common card I cant believe they released this without support. At start of game there was a notice that the card was not recommended and to choose between software or hardware mode. I chose hardware mode and the game seemed to run ok and I continued. However at the underwater levels it became increasingly unstable laggy until it crashed. If the card had been supported my star rating would have been 3.5 Pros: Nice artwork cute animation and sounds from the girl character. Puzzles were pleasant most easy but all requiring lots of press this and see what that does kind of stuff. Music was a repetitive loop but so mild that it was not too annoying and the loop was atmospheric. The underwater level is very pretty. Nice game mechanic to switch different views to enable new actions on the same spot. Cons: Annoyances ruined immersion mainly there is no way to escape animations which due to most of the puzzles being of a physical nature such as pull or push items it became repetitious and annoying having to wait till the animations were done between each action. Basically you often had to wait between each action while the character bounced and waddled here and there. Unclear menu options for ex the load icon looked like a save icon and led to losing progress in early stage. The intro is unskippable and rather long not a problem for most but as I was trying out the diff graphic card modes it became irritating. Overall if you exclude the graphic card nonsupport the game was pleasant enough to buy on deep discount. Expect lots of waiting for the action icon as animations run their course dont expect deep puzzles or story. It just a nice game to while away a few hours with no stress. , November 8 2016, This game does not support AMD Radeon 7700 graphics card which was not stated in the storefront page,travis,a
Where The Water Tastes Like Wine," Where The Water Tastes Like Wine lets you wander continental America during the Great Depression. The main goal is to meet with other travelers and learn their stories and share smaller stories that you collect in different regions. The regions also have their own soundtrack which is excellent - the songs do end up repeating a lot but didn t become unwelcome. The smaller stories you collect do have small interactive moments where you can guide where it goes and they re definitely more interesting because of that. You share these stories with the characters you meet along the way. Sharing stories also lets them  into the wildwhere they might return to you in a different form. The characters are well-written and tell a lot about the time you re in. Some of them are excellent. Some are just odd and are completely out of place - for a game that works hard at evoking a time period it was frankly annoying to hear a story from a completely different decade. Others have commented on the travel which does wear on you. I sunk the first eight or so hours just wandering collecting stories meeting people and really enjoying myself. After a while you have to  finish upby finding characters as they wander but there s no easy way to do so. The routes are tedious dangerous for no reason and usually if I had a bug (there are a few) one of these shortcuts was involved. And by the way! The character in the intro is another character you have to tell stories to - the ending seems to be different depending on how often you encounter him during the game and at the end. I only saw him at the end didn t have any other chances to interact with him and got a really basic ending (""Hope you enjoyed yourself!"") that left me wondering what happened. You don t get to go back and work on a better ending - that s it. So the stories told are excellent but you ll need to go into it with some spoilers and a lot of patience to enjoy yourself.

Gorogoa," A beautiful imaginative gem. Quite short but worth every second and would have overstayed its welcome if it was any longer. However this is a game for people who like to watch pretty art and watch interesting things in motion. The puzzles are not difficult enough for anyone who considers themself a puzzle game fan - they re just the right difficulty to give you nice ""a-ha!"" moments. And the story exists more as a sequence of feelings and emotions than as a sequence of events. If you are looking for a complex puzzle game or an intricate story there s a fair chance you ll be disappointed. But if you know what this game is and you like it it ll be a brilliant experience that ll stay with you for a long time. ", September 8 2018, A beautiful imaginative gem,russo1958,a

Gonner, It s a pretty looking platformer that is 30 years backward in terms of gameplay. This is the kind of annoying style of platform that was prevalent during the 80s and early 90s in the veins of early Castlevania and Ghost nGoblins. It s basically a game that doesn t want you to have fun by designing the controls and levels to put you at the most disadvantaged position. To be fair the controls aren t as bad as Castlevania 1 or Ghost nGoblins i.e. they are responsive but they aren t intuitive; it does what you want it to do but you can t do much with it. And to be fair this game is a ton less frustrating than Castlevania 1 or Ghost and Goblins. Even so we are in an era where platforms have evolved into something genuinely clever and interesting (such as Braid and Blackhole) and not resort to limit the amount of control a player has in the game. The way this game is made it feels insulting to a gamer for example if I wanted to play an annoying platform like Castlevania 1 or Ghost nGoblins I would play Castlevania 1 and Ghost nGoblins instead of this. GoNNER could ve been something pretty special and interesting but instead the torrid gameplay cheapens the experience. Despite my misgivings GoNNER isn t a bad game but it s no fun playing it. , November 28 2017, It s a pretty looking platformer that is 30 years backward in terms of gameplay,bass,a

Shining Song Starnova, Anyone who s played Love in Space s previous works in the Sunrider universe will immediately be familiar with the artwork. It may not necessarily be to everyone s liking but I found it to be pleasant enough and I liked that the seven girls in the story were reasonably distinct in their artistic style. (Possibly minor spoilers ahead) The game starts with a fairly lengthy (3-4 hours at least) introduction where for the most part it s just reading through the story. This bit can be a bit cliche in numerous ways but eventually you get to the point where you get to pick from the seven girls (one of whom is locked until you complete all other routes). I have yet to complete all the routes (done 5 of 7 so far) but the girlsstories are considerably more interesting than the introduction. There are definitely some shocking and dramatic moments that you definitely wouldn t expect in an idol game/story and I don t mean sexual content. Many of the stories make me feel that this is designed specifically for adults even if you play the GoG family friendly version. For the most part this is a kinetic VN with few choices. There are good and bad endings but you ll know VERY quickly when you get a bad ending. I ve played for 18 hours so far and I estimate I ll be done in about 24. I m a fast reader so you might get more out of it but I d imagine that 30 hours is probably the max someone could play this game. Aside from the slow and boring start I believe that this is a story worth exploring. As a fan of popular Japanese idol franchises I was pleasantly surprised that Starnova has storylines that do not follow idol conventions. Any fan of visual novels and idols should definitely give it a try and 20-30 hours is a decent length of time for a reasonably priced VN. Just endure the initial slog and you ll find some interesting and engaging stories. , August 7 2018, Anyone who s played Love in Space s previous works in the Sunrider universe will immediately be familiar with the artwork,noel6273,a
Battlestar Galactica Deadlock," I own this game on Steam and I ""eventually"" enjoyed it. Background: Mankind is at war with its own creation the AI known as Cylons. Mankind consists of 12 planetary colonies similar to the US colonies. You are put in command of Colonial Fleet which is the equivalent of the Continental US Army of the War of Independence. You are basically George Washington ""IN SPAAAAAACE"". (God it felt good to write this!) Anyway support for your fleet in the form of resources has to be earned by protecting the colonies with your multiple fleets that you will eventually have. Gamplay: on the strategic level you organize and move your fleets build new ships pointlessly upgrade your captains etc. and on the tactical level you fight the battles in a pretty neat and easy to use simulation. While the simulation system itself offers a lot of options and tactics that makes for fun and interesting gameplay there are limiting factors: 1) The campaign takes FAR too long. For about 2/3 of the campaign I was stuck with low- and mid-tier ships because you need more fleets rather than few powerful fleets in order to earn more resources. 2) Low- and mid-tier ships mainly use broadside weaponry which means that you ll stack 3-4 frigattes above one another to maximise firepower. That is what you do for 2/3 of the campaign meaning dozens of battles each taking about 10-15 mins. 3) Weapon and ship designs are tied to story missions 1 per mission meaning the very best ships only see combat in the last 1 or 2 story missions. However once you have the cool stuff: best Battlestars Bombers Nukes supply ships the game becomes incredibly good. My advice: Power through as many story missions as your fleet can handle as early as possible. So early campaign 2/5 late campaign (incl. generous auto-resolve) 4/5. And for heaven s sake check where the guns are on each ship. The top of a Battlestar is the Grim Reaper personified! If you like naval combat or the theme go for it.

The Park, If you re not a fan of walking simulator games this isn t for you- aside from walking and running about the only thing you can do is examine notes and objects. With that out of the way The Park does a fairly decent job at setting up a creepy atmosphere. The idea of exploring an abandoned amusement park and riding a bunch of scary broken-down rides is fun all on its own and the park looks and sounds great- from the rusted buildings to the indistinct voices whispering over the PA system it delivers a spooky vibe from the start. Unfortunately it doesn t go much beyond that. The story is told through narration and notes and while the protagonist s past eventually becomes clear the story of the park itself and what s actually happening remain somewhat ambiguous and the ending leaves more questions than answers coming abruptly and with no real payoff. The game is so short there s not much room for it to breathe and expand upon things and it feels rather pointless and cheap as a result. It feels more like a casual trip to a real amusement park than a narrative experience. During the first half of the game you explore the park and hit all the rides and this is definitely the best part- most of the rides deliver an experience that s either fun scary or both. The character of the Boogeyman or ringmaster is actually pretty unsettling which makes it all the more disappointing that he s secondary to the protagonist s personal history. The second half of the game fills in a lot of backstory but is fairly dull and confined by comparison and leads to an unsatisfying climax. The Park is a spinoff of The Secret World and I m not sure if playing that game would improve the experience- but standing on its own The Park doesn t quite hold up. It s only 3 to 5 hours long at most and probably not worth the base price- but pick it up on sale some time. The rides alone are worth investing a couple hours into it. , September 19 2018, If you re not a fan of walking simulator games this isn t for you- aside from walking and running about the only thing you can do is examine notes and objects,conrad5652,a
Not A Hero, Not a Hero is yet another paper-thin game that relies solely on a not-very-original mechanic. It s yet another run and gun game only this time with 2D pixel art. It doesn t really have a plot to speak of but rather pointless challenges you need to complete to unlock new characters. Sadly it s so unfun it s a game purely for completionists. You can complete the levels without doing any of the side challenges but there s no fun in it since it s far too easy. And doing the side challenges isn t very fun either - there s no joy in collecting carrots or kittens or reaching a certain checkpoint in time. But without those side challenges the game is empty. Sadly trying to complete all challenges is extremely frustrating - not because of the skill required but because of how easy it is botch a run. Getting everything perfect requires playing the same level over and over again at first to get familiar with it and later to find the path the game s creators want you to take to complete it as easily &amp; quickly as possible. Because a great run can be ruined by something as simple as getting too close to an enemy. Enemies can punch you sometimes sending you flying through a window into a lower floor with no way to return to the floor you were in. There is some fun in unlocking new characters but you quickly realize that they re either decent or atrocious making you stick to the same handful of characters. There s just very little thought put behind this game - it s a hodgepodge of ideas and mechanics done better elsewhere. There is humor to this game but it s so nonsensical it rarely comes across as funny. , August 10 2018, Not a Hero is yet another paper-thin game that relies solely on a not-very-original mechanic,norton2161,a

Opus Magnum, Having finished playing games like Fortresscraft and Factorio but not being in the mood for puzzle games anymore I had passed on Opus Magnum for a while now. But it being on sale piqued my interest. So I went ahead and purchased the game being slightly wary of the  puzzlinessI may encounter. Fortunately the solutions you create can be inefficient monstrosities if you so choose or you can make a concerted effort to streamline your machines.

Bit.Trip Beat," I ve owned a few version of bit.trip beat (right back to the original wii release) and I have to say that it is one of the best rhythm games on the market. It is deceptive in that is looks simple but it throws a lot novel &amp; mind bending challenges at you even if it is a memorization heavy game. The presentation of the game is fantastic both in the soundtrack but also in the visuals. The 3 boss fights are varied and interesting. Now for the shortcomings of the game.

The Coma: Recut," From a gameplay perspective Coma has little to offer: A 2D exploration through a korean highschool you can t do anything else but go left or right and interact with objects. There s no challenge to it. You can use a flashlight but I found it unnecessary. The monster chasing you isn t special either if at least it s AI were more sophisticated and it had a persistent place in the world so you could logically try to avoid it (think Alien: Isolation style) while it grew more and more powerful with time as the game claims but doesn t happen gameplay-wise. The sprite changes but it doesn t actually do anything new. Exploration is dull as the enviroment is sadly fairly uninteresting. For me someone living far away from South Korea a legitimate look at a highschool there would be very interesting instead you re running around in a dark building and you don t get to actually see how the school runs. It s drawn well I guess. The animations could be more fluid though. Story-wise which for me could excuse the gameplay *if* it were good is sadly as dull as the gameplay. The characters are stereotypes the notes around the building are uninteresting and don t give a good enough look into an entirely different culture to excuse to bad characters and plot. I couldn t even bring myself to finish this game and stopped what seems to be half-way through. The driving motivation (to get out of the school) isn t strong enough as I don t care about the player character at all. Considering the game advertises itself as ""showing the stressful life of a highschool student in South Korea"" it spends very little time in the real world. I d rather have the mistery be more subtle grounded in the real world so you get to explore the school while it is intact get to experience those stories you keep reading the notes about. That s the problem: The notes (the only ""lore"" in the game) tease interesting stuff but you don t get to see it.

Mushroom 11, Completed the game. Overall liked it. But I suspect that many people who left bad scores ragequitted at some point because game is difficult and has pacing problems. In Mushroom 11 erasing parts of mushroom is the main mechanic. -Puzzles in game are execution puzzles. Not in platformer sense where you have to push jump with correct timing. This type of execution puzzle is completely novel and requires great precision. -Physics puzzles generally in my opinion have problems. Some puzzles I don t like: keeping up with rotating wheel doing cuts when rotating correct weight distribution in deadly situations. Most of them are just frustrating and when they work it feels like miracle and not an achievement. -I felt that collecting flowers and things is not interesting. It seems that they are only for completionists. But there are a lot of them. I would prefer that they appear in secret areas only. -Type of puzzle I liked the most - puzzles where you have to use precision cuts and just think carefully about your path. -Puzzle I did not like - rockets. They require fast reflexes and work by chance. -Environment design is great. It feels like it tells the story.

Dragon S Dogma: Dark Arisen, One of the best if not THE best third person action RPGs I have ever played. It rewards you for learning and punishes you for refusing to adapt to its ever changing monsters. The combat is visceral and gives a weighty feel to every movement from a simple swing to the launching of a brigand fifteen feet in the air. The Ferrystones and Port Crystals are an interesting and helpful system. Using them allows you to fast travel to anywhere in the world you want as long as you ve been there and placed one of those Port Crystals down.

Crime Cities," This is the game that gets one s guts by the dense atmosphere it creates. Although it has been eighteen years since its release Crime Cities still provides players with dynamic and challenging gameplay. The story told in the game is not the prime factor but adds a few bits to the dark cyberpunk world developed by Techland. One must never turn the music off as it REALLY builds up tension and emotions. Actually the soundtrack is what makes this game at least for me - it is perfectly fitted with the futuristic environment (I admit I sometimes play the soundtrack aside from the game). The AI of enemies is a no-brainer it follows a simple pattern - when you are in the range of enemy weapons they shoot at you no matter the obstacles or the fact that they shoot at each another ;-). Hostile vehicles start their pursuit either on sight or as soon as you fire upon them. The missions offered by the game follow a few patterns but for most of the time it is all about destroying hostile targets. Be careful about abandoning some of them as it may end up with ""Deux ex Machina"" represented by a bunch of fast and swift flyers with only one directive - shoot you down. Despite the lack of real NPC s some figures are quite memorable (and I don t necessarily mean the main ones) thanks to the way they ""speak"" to you via e-mails. I will stress it once more - neither the plot nor the people are the strength of this production. There are a few flaws (somewhat buggy AI a few unbalanced missions) but honestly said - I had lots of fun with this game. It also forces you to think what you spend your earned money on. The diversity of equipment allows you to choose the best strategy for you. I wish they remade it one day or developed a sequel (or a prequel). Thank you Techland for this game.

Q.U.B.E. 2 Season Pass," If you like the puzzles in Q.U.B.E. 2 you ll probably like this DLC. The Lost Orbit puzzle pack was fun to play even though it was also frustrating when I couldn t figure out what to do right away. Even though it could be frustrating it was also very satisfying when I realized the solutions to the puzzles and how to access the areas containing the collectibles. A word of warning however -- this puzzle pack is entirely reliant on the green cube. Every puzzle involves one or more green cubes (they also utilize the blue propel tiles and the orange platform tiles) so if you don t like the green cubes for whatever reason you won t like the Lost Orbit puzzle pack. According to the in-game stats it took me 6:63:16 to finish the Lost Orbit puzzle pack (yes that middle number is ""63"" for some reason). If you re good at solving puzzles and quickly determining what you need to do then you ll probably finish quite a bit more quickly than that. I was stumped for a while on a few of these puzzles. This Season Pass also includes the soundtrack (in FLAC and MP3 formats) which is somewhat haunting and absolutely beautiful. I don t recall if the base game had any music while playing but the Lost Orbit puzzle pack does not have any music (neither while solving the puzzles nor upon completion). Overall I m very happy with this purchase and look forward to the release of the second puzzle pack. ", September 18 2018, If you like the puzzles in Q,rice2194,a
Age Of Wonders, As a kid i used to play rts games almost exclusively. I did try a few turn-based games but they always struck me as boring or too complicated. However Age of Wonders struck me as different. it had interesting graphics beautiful music and intuitive gameplay. For a long time it was the only turn-based strategy that i could and wanted to play. I can say with certainty that although almost 20 years old AoW still holds that charming and fun aroma that makes it worth having. Here is a shot analysis of key game elements: Gameplay - Overall a standard turn-based system you research and produce units in your cities and towns via gold form them into stacks and march them off to new conquests. Your empire doesn t need micromanagement and what little of it is there is fairly easy and quick. Your playing area is divided into a world map with up to three layers (overland underground and depths) peppered with various independent sites and creatures. In combat there is the option of manual combat (fighting on a special tactical map with direct unit commanding) or a quick auto-resolve. There is also a rpg element as your hero levels up and can gain new spells and equipment from wizard towers and ancient ruins/dungeons respectively. Story - The story is a fairly nice if straightforward one. Long ago elven king Inioch maintained the balance between good and evil races but one day humans came after being banished and slew Inioch and his court. You take the role of one of his two surviving children - Julia head of The Keepers and Meandor leader of the Cult of Storms. There are multiple endings based on your ally choice which adds a nice variety to the story s conclusion. Music - The soundtrack is truly endearing and provides an excellent epic backdrop and   feel to the game a true fantasy music. Miscellaneous - The player should keep their hero safe as his or her death means game over no matter what. In conclusion you won t regret buying this game. , October 3 2018, As a kid i used to play rts games almost exclusively,sherman705,a
The Testament Of Sherlock Holmes," ""The testament of Sherlock Holmes"" is one of the most annoting game experiences I ve encountered the past ten years or so. The puzzles are either stupidly simple or insanely diffuclt scenes are seemingly stitched together in a most unnatural way. Worst of all is the dialog which is laughable. Especially annoying is Watson who is supposed to be a sidekick that can give you valuable advice. But with this incompetent implementation he is nothing more than a dummy and possible the most annoying character in a game ever. He constantly annoy the hell out of this player with stupid nonsense dialogue. There are some very good production values here for sure (graphics are nice good voice representing for Holmes) but the overall execution cheapens everything with horrible cuts between camera angles and scenes untimed conversations and bad animation. All this hurts the immersion for the player. Even though the controls are said to be an improvement over previous games they are still lacking. All things added this game makes for a slow painful and enervating experience. When the adventure genre went downhill a bit during the late 90 s/early 00 s europen developers kept it alive. However even though some were fairly successful they didn t improve on anything. In most cases the opposite were true. I m going as far as stating that ""The Testament of Sherlock Holmes"" wouldn t have been released during the golden era of the genre. It s different today though. Since the big AAA developers don t put pressure on the smaller developer s it s much harder today to get hold of a really well crafted adventure games. That s why Frogware can release such a horrible excuse for an adventure game and still continue on. If you value story and immersion this is not a game for you.

Master Of Orion," So on the plus side: this does provides entertainment value in the respect that you can point and laugh at how bad it is. Now to the actual review: Banking on nostalgia half baked lazy cash grab. Not living up to a game released (!)two decades(!) ago in graphics design or game-play. DRM locked garbage selling you HALF of a crappy lazy MOO2 remake and shipping the rest in separate DLCs (I kid you not - the only thing they could ve done worse would be cutting everything after the plasma cannons and leaving you battling with lasers only before you buy an extra game pack) Oh and don t forget: it s called MOO. Not MOO4 or Master of Andromeda or whatever. Just MOO. Lol. AND the DLCs are of course named MOO: Origins MOO: Revelations MOO: Revolutions MOO: Armageddon MOO: Shadow of Meklon MOO: Rise of Sol etc. ROFL. Subtitles are so rad. :facepalm: This game is a perfect illustration on EVERYTHING that is wrong with the industry step by step. Oh.

Ys Seven, Coming into YS Seven I knew to expect what I always expect in a Ys game; fun combat challenging and enjoyable boss fights and excellent soundtracks. Its safe to say I am impressed once again with how they keep improving in each game. The feature that stands out in this game is the group tag team. I was surprised how intuitive the switching between characters would be on a game that has a lot going during combat. Fortunately is it not the only stand out feature in this game. Tech skill selections crafting/farming and side quests I havent experienced in previous series. The combat is oh so enjoyable. Typical Ys combat fun but with the tag teaming twist to it. The only con I could say is the graphics are meh. They arent terrible and were typical for PSP. I wished the port would have had much crisper graphics. None the less its hardly a hiderance. The gameplay is very good you get over that rather quick. Easy 5.

Quern - Undying Thoughts, As other reviews point out this is much more than a Myst-style game. There s a semblance of a plot. There are plenty of puzzles ranging from inventory (finding objects from other parts of the map) to logic. This is what Obduction or The Witness could have been. You slowly unlock areas of the map - a nice touch - limiting what would otherwise be futile exploration. Around half way through you end up in another zone. Occasionally I felt lost because I missed / forgot a detail from a place quite far away in the map. This meant I resorted to a walkthrough for one or two pieces. One or two puzzles were frustrating mainly because you have to set something up in one place walk over to another and check the result. That didn t detract however from a very enjoyable time playing the game. Definitely recommended. , October 30 2018, As other reviews point out this is much more than a Myst-style game,reese,a
The Bard S Tale Trilogy, Thanks for bringing out this piece of RPG History back to life. At the time the game was released in 1985 i was only 6 years old and didn t play to it until i was 10 or something. But still at that time as i am not an english native it was hard for me to understand the mechanics of the game. Now at the age of 39 (soon 40... god -_-) and thanks to you devs i finally completed the first ever RPG video game i tried back in time on C64 / Amiga 500. My experience is somewhat mixed as it was a real pleasure and a pain in the ass at the same time :-D But anyway of course i ll give it a 5 on 5 ! I knew bard s tale was a HARD game because back in time it was like that and we would spend hours and hours to finish a game. Talk about good money investment ;-) Thanks for the Automap thanks for the Quicksave for the man i am now with a family these were great features as it allowed me to complete the game in just 38 hours.

Hard Reset Redux, Hard Reset Redux is an FPS set in a dystopian sci-fi world. The player takes the role of Major James Fletcher a corporative enforcer called on to fight the menace of a machine invasion on Bezoar City. The story has a few twists and even though they are vairly obvious to any sci-fi fan the tropes work well here. The scenario reminded me a lot of the first Blade Runner movie as well as the original book (Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep? - by Phillip K. Dick); the plot itself seems to borrow several concepts from Second Variety (one of Dick s short stories) as well as some from Farenheit 451 (Ray Bradbury s famous story on the death of contemplation). For a sci-fi reader these elements are enough to create a very immersive experience although some choices might break the experience a bit. In between missions the story is told by comic-book-shaped scenes. the aesthetics are interesting but the dialogue is rushed for some reason making the story convoluted at times even though it isn t that complex to begin with. Small matters aside it s a very interesting plot coupled elegantly with the missions. It s a shame that the story ends on a cliffhanger. Even so it made me wish for a sequel a feeling that rarely strikes me in such situations. The game itself seems to be shaped around the idea of old FPS. I haven t played the original Hard Reset (it is said to have been far more tactical than the Redux version). In here though the old strafe mechanics are heavily present even more so on account of dodges (easy to pull and very useful). At times the game shows discrepancies with what I imagine was its original version since the dodge allows the player to easily avoid most attacks while shooting enemies without much problem. Also weapon variety grants a nice arsenal with a weapon mode for every situation. As the player progresses through the game he ll be able to mdify through upgrades his two main weapons (also at some point Fletcher finds a sword which he can use for direct melee attacks in a surpirsingly satisfying ballet of destruction). Fletcher can use a SMG and a laser gun being able to unlock RPGs grenade launchers shock mods beam mods electric mortar mods and of course a shotgun. It is hard to find a favorite weapon mod since each situation begs for some mods to be used. (Even so I d rather run around with the shotgun like in old Doom and Blood games!) Some of these modifications will cause distinct effects upon the enemies stunning delaying or exploding areas they pass through (such is the case with the mine launcher). The maps are linear for the most part but they branch out in creative ways holding a few secrets (mostly nanites you collect to upgrade weapons in purchase stations). There s a bit of backtracking but for the most part maps flow quite well. Models and scenario are used to tell the story and showcase enemies you ll find later on. The scenario is used in interesting ways helping to develop the story and giving the impression of a lively setting. Maps are constantly made of partitions that won t open up until you kill all enemies in the area. This is adequately merged into the game for example since everything around simply stops working as AI driven machines are detected (for public safety and in order to help fend off the menace). Some parts are a bit immersion-braking though. For example the character can t crouch. Several parts of the map are made so small machines can pass through creating unreachable areas and spawn points. All in all it still maintain balance and this is a very minor thing. Overall the game is great delivering an old sci-fi story through an old FPS style. Damn shame it s too short - a straight playthrough took me 4 hours. Still it s just so good that I m going back to find all secrets in a new game plus playthrough. Highly recommended! , September 16 2018, Hard Reset Redux is an FPS set in a dystopian sci-fi world,gill,a

Drakkhen, I played this game on the Amiga 500 many many years ago. What I remember was a joy filled romp through a world that wanted you dead. My visit back here taught me that rpg s have seriously come a long ways in the last few decades. The game itself is fine. You create your party and the various classes all serve their purpose. Where the issue lies is simply poor implementation. First big issue: Awful pathfinding. Lets say you are walking through a room full of chairs and tables. Obviously you personally will attempt to move around them and thus will make it from one side to the other. In this game however thats just not the case. You tell your character to just walk through a room and they tend to just wander to their own location. Or just don t and get stuck on a single pixel. Spell Casting: Now in combat you can tell your characters to use magic and they will kind of attempt to use magic rather willy nilly. But if you say want to cast heal on one of your characters you will have some rather unpleasant experiences wasting mana trying to land a heal. Aim for the targets feet and make sure nothing is in the way as spells can easily miss/get trapped by almost anything. Combat in general: Combat is more or less automated. Characters will just crab walk their way at one another and swing and it follows standard rpg style. There is little user imput and much of the time you feel powerless in changing the outcome. Experience Gain: Only killing blows appear to give exp. This makes leveling up less melee oriented classes (priest comes to mind) a bit of a pain. Difficulty Curve: A game like this is expected to be difficult. What really made me rage quit was the utter insanity of all the previous issues mixed with random encounters that can only be described as utterly insane. In the second dungeon you will find that the  bosswill just randomly teleport and one shot you. Cause he can. Mix that with the previous issues and you have this game. It s just not fun now , September 15 2018, I played this game on the Amiga 500 many many years ago,terry,a

Death S GamBit, There is a good game hidden in here somewhere. The graphics are pretty and the voice acting that is there is actually good. Unfortunately the voice over is incomplete as a noticeable amount of lines from conversations are missing. The story is forgetable but there are a few nice ideas in the way how it is told and the world design is ok. But... As of now one month after release 2 patches and a hotfix later although playable the game is still riddled with bugs poor UI and localization. The combat system feels slugish even with the fastest weapons and some of the mechanics make no sense. It s almost as if somebody looked at Dark Souls took some parts from it and changed them just enough to make them worse. Like loosing feathers (=Estus flask equivalent) on death. Other systems feel underdeveloped like the horse or the weapon upgrades. Maybe with 6 months of extra development time things would have turned out differently.

Stargunner, An Apogee game the very last one and one I had not played. I was very hyped and looking forward to th is. But...it was not to be. The sprrites are huge and poorly made animations and effects are subpar your attack graphics are the same with the enemy s. The levels are mostly variations of three themes (space terran and oceanic) and the enemy sprites are uninspired. On one level you fight a floating megacity that has a size similar to your ship and on the very next level you fight against realistic human battleship much larger than an enire floating city. The game itself is unnecessarily tough with whole levels existing just to screw with the player. The end game bosses can either be exploited due to poor design or they will totally murder you. And even worse between each episode you lose your hard earned progress. This is not a game I can recommend and I am grateful I got it for free.

Windward," 3.5 stars for what it is and not pretending to be anything else. It s a game about sailing a toy ship in a toy lake and doing quests for toy towns often involving bombarding and blowing up other toy ships or towns. If you re looking for depth or story you won t find it here but that s not a strike against its design as there s plenty of polish for what s here. If you re looking for a sense of achievement the linear level progression upwards is brutal without friends or joining in multiplayer and is a treadmill grind to no particular destination but ""the end"" is not the purpose of a sandbox. If you re looking to explore the maps are procedurally generated and only contain barely-navigable landmasses decorated with shipwrecks and the occasional battlements and towns yet every biome has its charm and the varied layouts and wind activity can make for interesting navigation challenges. Despite the shallow nature of Windward it s a very well put-together game. The activities are varied and satisfying enough that you can kick back and relax to some peaceful trading and questing role-playing with friends or hunt pirates or even conquer some toy towns for better loot if the mood strikes you. The biggest draw is perhaps the online multiplayer and persistent maps however I found the linear level progression is at odds with that feature and means you ll very likely be playing by yourself in any case if you don t have friends leveling up along side you.

Paradigm is never too difficult and that is not a bad thing (though some clues are not as conveniently repeated as others) and Paradigm hits everywhere with its humor so when you are not laughing out hard you are at least in awe of the level of madness behind it.

Enigmatis: The Ghosts Of Maple Creek," Enigmatis is a very simple casual adventure straight off the bat mixed with hidden object scenes. I said simple so you pick up/use staffs play minigames and no item combination which is fine by me. Truely I don t favourised the hidden object part due to the tiny objects! I played many more interested Hidden Objects games this one was frustrating. The makers probably realised it because the bonus chapter ""Ghosts of the Past"" already improved that. I had to mention Enigmatis 2 much better in this. The story not really intimidating unless you finish the game and start the Bonus Chapter which in my opinion the best of Maple Creek. Knowing the fate of Hamilton s girlfriend from the base game makes really interesting how things happened! Of course you go way back in time this time as Hamilton to investigate what happened to his girlfriend.

The game nagged me to use a controller (I think) on loading; I set my own controls but there were lots of confusing elements e.g. picking up an item gave options to ""use"" (which I think would destroy the item if it was single use) or to go to the inventory - but in the inventory I had trouble quitting back out so often was just moving a cursor between a map and equipment. I think I had to press escape but it only worked on the map? It seemed clunky. A sword powerup appeared as a piece of equipment separate from the sword (and it seemed to disappear later). Those kind of things left me scratching my head and wanting to avoid picking anything up just to avoid the inventory interface. All that stuff is easily fixable but at present it made the first experiences of the game more painful than they should be. I m sure I ll give it another go at a later date.

Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising, You are the commander of Antaeus a high-tech cruiser that has been sunk in the last war and now lifted up from the bottom of the sea in a desperate attempt to stop a terrorist organization known as Cabal. The ship features a nano-factory capable of producing helicopters hovercraft and tanks almost instantly given that you supply it with enough energy. For this purpose you will scavenge everything from cars to harbor cranes take apart factories and clean up battlefields littered with remains of annihilated enemies. You will be accompanied by a crew of fallen soldiers whose personality has been recorded using experimental technology. Each one of the soldiers at your disposal has his own set of traits and skills - one of them is an aggressive helicopter pilot another excels in operating a howitzer... The crew members react on each other scold the ones they don t like and praise the ones they do. The voice acting is great the cinematic sequences are even better. The story sounds cheesy at first but the little twists are good enough to keep you interested. The graphics is of course dated but nevertheless very good. This might be just a personal choice but I really like the clean look it has. If you dabble in 3D art yourself - draw inspiration from this game. What the artists could do with just a few dozen polygons per building/unit is amazing. The game environment is also fully destructible. PROS - Excellent gameplay - Great cinematic sequences and voice acting - Entertaining crew members - Completely destructible environment. From buildings to the last deckchair on the beach - if it s not terrain you can blow it up CONS - Minor pathfinding and target priority problems - Despite all the effort missions might get a little repetitive at the end - The story seems a little naive in some aspects but is mature in other - There really isn t much of a progression in weapons that can be equipped - Field of vision takes some getting used to Overall a great game. , March 12 2018, You are the commander of Antaeus a high-tech cruiser that has been sunk in the last war and now lifted up from the bottom of the sea in a desperate attempt to stop a terrorist organization known as Cabal,cruz3050,a

Ceville," First: This adventure is one of my favorite ones but - usually I m used to that the other way round - the translation is really... not that good. Like many other ""funny"" adventures this one stands and falls with the humour and the jokes. In German this adventure the voice acting the jokes and references are (if you like parodies and dark humour/sarcasm-cynism) all-in-all great. Sadly this is almost completely missing in the English version. The lame (English) voice acting can t decide between Nicolas Cage and Kristen Stewart (where in German you get a Johnny Depp/Christoph Waltz) the mixing... ugh and the jokes are meh as well. Just as an example of the loss of quality: In German the reference would be ""I m selling these fine leather jackets..."" and the English translation: ""Do you want to buy a coat?"" - or like that clich?? when there s a neverending dialogue in English and the eastern european translator just says: ""I like you."".  Cause of that I switched back to/started a new game in German after 12 - 14 minutes. 800 % improvement. Graphics are good if you enjoy ""fake-3D"" adventures like Monkey Island 4 and ok if you don t. Like all ""funny"" adventures this game doesn t really tries to get you with a complicated and twisted story but with entertainment/jokes instead.

Tron 2.0," Just finished Tron 2.0 and enjoyed it so much was poking around on the reviews to see what others thought. In my personal games list I wrote: ""Very enjoyable first person shooter with some RPG elements for leveling character and weapons. Great sound and visual style. Linear game play but some replay-ability for those who wish to track down every last ""build point"" - might make sense when you play the game)."" A previous reviewer recorded a number of issues they had with the game and I was sorry to read that. I had a different experience (everyone will!) and wanted to include my take as a recent player. The quick save option (good old games - new game auto saves suck! haha) was my saviour as I loved trying different things or jumping into different sketchy places and then quickly reloading and moving on. I found the different weapon types were interesting and I used them all in different circumstances. I actually liked how the same Energy was used to power everything and I had to manage that during my battles. I would usually start battles with some early power hits with weapons that used Energy and then go back to using Disc. The Tron Disk also became my go-to weapon and I often had to use the right mouse button to call it back when it went off course. That even became a strategy to call it back for repeated hits on bosses. Other apps for Stealth Shield or Melee I would equip rarely but could be fun at times. Boss fights rarely required healing or energy for me (though some times I timed a dash during Boss weapon cool down). I searched out a sheltered ""sniping"" spot and kept launching Disc until it was over! For Corruption infection I would remove infected apps then do ""anti-virus"". I found most Boss fights had a gimmick required that would defeat them more quickly but generally just blasting them until it was over did the trick. Overall I found the game holds up very well in visual sound and game play and I enjoyed every minute of my experience. ", October 29 2018, Just finished Tron 2,hoover1726,a

Carmageddon Max Pack, ...but quickly boring. This game has so many problems that makes it frustrating better than fun. First the progression system. You have to progress from rank 99 up to rank 1. To do so you have to collect credits in each mission varying with the difficulty setting. I admit I have cheated the main game data file to progresse faster. In normal mode I couldn t rank up more than once per race up to 77 ! With the credits you collect you can respawn and repair but it costs to eyeballs each time ! You gain 3k credits wasting an opponent in normal mode it costs 2k to respawn and as you end upside down for almost each jump or collision you do you paying a total 30k just to be able to play thanks to a weird management of physics. Overall manoeuverability is mediocre it s hard to take any turn or just make 180?? in this game whatever your vehicle is. Cars unlock REEEEEEALLY slowly. Through the 99 ranks you can mostly unlock around 5 cars. Useful cars are unlocked towards the end of course but you ll mainly use the starter car which is too well balanced besides other cars. When you finished the game you unlock the 25 other cars by default which of course are more useful than those unlocked through game s course. AI is really dumb seriously. The game s mostly a competition based game with bot AI rather than basic NPCs but while they should hit anyne within their range they team up against the player ending with the player bouncing from an opponent to a police car to another opponent. Races are shortly timed to gain time you can either crush peds ram cars or hit green barrels but sometimes you re just stucked between opponent cars at the beginning you can t gain time you lose in 30 seconds. How fun. To end this the last course I had took me ONE HOUR AND A HALF because I tried to wreck an unwreckable opponent and ended finishing a 12 laps wario stadium lenght like race. Alone. Seriosuly fun the first half boring the second. , January 22 2018, ,kline9436,a
Avadon: The Black Fortress, Avadon is a homage to isometric rpg s that predate Baldur s Gate and the grand era of Black Isle. However it does improve and update on those mechanics in that it gives the player many more options on how to interact with them. The graphics are simple and often fail to convey atmosphere. This is due primarily to the matt colour choice and simplified palette. Many props are reused in multiple areas and so fail to give areas a distinct feeling despite variations in layout. The character sprites however are well animated and move in a natural manner. The gameplay itself is strongly turnbased (even though you have the option to play without pause). However the strategic elements of combat mean that you will of necessity be leaving it as turn-based. Battles are varied enough and the game scales well. The game requires long term planning and not just battle strategy as bosses are often encountered near the end after normal mobs when resources are more scarce. Questing tends to be fairly linear and most sidequests can be completed alongside the main quest with little deviation from the main pathline. Only a few sidequests require additional exploration. The quests themselves are not very diverse yet are varied enough to not be repetitive. The characters are forgettable and their individual stories not particularly interesting which is a pity as it lead to less player engagement as roleplaying is simplified. Something particularly irksome in an RPG. However the main quest is compelling and interesting. It uses choices that are often morally grey and explores how choices affect various groups in positive or negative ways. I d recommend this game only to people who enjoy the genre itself it is not a game that lends itself to new players of the genre. It is mainly for those who require a nostalgia kick or who are interested in seeing what narratives in games can be capable of , September 4 2018, Avadon is a homage to isometric rpg s that predate Baldur s Gate and the grand era of Black Isle,May-95,a

Tex Murphy: The Pandora Directive, I can t play it through Day Four because there is a bomb that must be diffused that requires you to be able to differentiate red and green. I suppose I could maybe get a friend to do it for me but I m not all that into the mystery anyway. It s about Roswell aliens. It s hard to care. And the humor rarely lands. I m not sure why these games are so fondly remembered. They are definitely on the lower end of the adventure game scale based on what I ve played so far (Under a Killing Moon and this). Most of the game is running back and forth talking to the same four or five people over and over and over again about every new topic hoping it unlocks the next thing. One time I had to show a letter in a foreign script to a guy working in a diner so he could tell me what language it was written in then I had to go to a guy working in a pawn shop ask about the language to be given a book of this dead language for beginners. In a world where they could hire a few more actors why would I talk to either of these schmucks? Wouldn t it have made more sense for me to go to a library? Also the movement controls are really annoying and there s some pixel hunting. Are there puzzles? Nothing too complicated that I ve seen so far.

Subterrain," I am surprised that none of the other reviews here mentioned what essentially drives everything in this game = ""the constant time pressure"". The infection rate is increasing essentially per minute and every single real time second counts if you don t want to get overwhelmed by waves of too strong enemies. You have to line up your research manufacturing looting trips and taking care of your bodily functions just perfectly to avoid ""swimming"" in enemies. So for me the greatest CON of this otherwise good game is that the enemies don t scale with player progression but only by time passed. And the higher the difficulty the shorter time You have to outpace that enemy progression.

Aggressors: Ancient Rome," While my very first impression of this game was ""Hmmm... nothing special"" I have since considerably revised my opinion; the more I play the more intrigued I become wishing to delve deeper into its systems and  invisibledepth -- indeed even its historical context. Perhaps I ll first tell readers what it [i]isn t[/i]: it isn t [i]Civ[/i] or [i]Total War[/i] or even [i]Hegemony[/i] all of which I have played and wast--err...in which I ve sunk hundreds of hours. While it has elements of all these and more it carves its own niche with more or less unique takes on morale happiness supply and combat mechanics among others. It s also well-rooted in history -- something for which the first two games mentioned above have been critiqued -- while offering its own sandbox mode and virtually infinite modding/scenario creation possibilities. Some may criticise its aesthetics and a lot of the written material (in English. at least) -- I initially did in my own head anyway -- but one should keep in mind that its dev team is very small non-native English speakers and other than that the map at least grew on me; it s quite beautiful in its own way. Not only that the Dev support I ve seen is second to none IMO -- and I have played a lot of games over the years (you see I m very old!). Planned DLC is already in the works -- what other dev firm asks explicitly in their forums for user-input on this sort of thing? -- and its potential for a virtually endless stream of content -- official or not -- is already manifesting. So if you re on the fence I suggest you ignore so-called  reviewerswho have less than a good night s sleep invested in this game; IMO they should not be allowed to post opinions in such a forum.

Bionic Dues, The Good: This is a game where you can pause and ponder any moment and you should because it needs careful tactics. It has a casual simplicity and yet there are enough options to make it interesting. You can save at any moment. Also there is a certain tongue-in-the-cheek tone in all the equipment descriptions that I like. replayability is good: take a different set of exos (player robots) and a different leader and you will get a slightly different feel. The player robots remind me of RPG stereotypes: the fighter rogue wizard and barbarian robots (no healers though). The bad: Bionic Dues the title is just too lame; probably all the good ones were taken? Also the battle maps: a mission in the sewers and a mission in an office building look...both like the inside of a dark hangar. How difficult can it be to make like the background for sewers green and change the cover objects for the office building from machine parts to say filing cabinets and water coolers? What little feeling there is of storyline is lost because missions may play a little different and give different loot but FEEL very much all the same (except a bit the assassination mission where there are electric floors no other mission has).

Crusader Kings Complete, See my full detailed review here: http://www.rindis.com/blog/1859 Strategy games journalist Troy Goodfellow once said that Crusader Kings wasn???t Paradox???s best game but it was his favorite from them (this was in 2011 before CK II came out) and while I???m not sure what my favorite Paradox game would be I can well understand his sentiment. Once again Paradox showed that they could take the same basic game structure and deliver a very different feel. From the grand sweep of empires across the globe in Europa Universalis to the very detailed study of society and internal politics of Victoria this time the game has a very personal feel. It isn???t a role-playing game and cannot be mistaken for one as there are no real characters here and no dialog no spark of life behind the actors on the stage. But the actors are there and they are people and not countries. The common failure of most grand strategy games is to ignore the centrifugal forces that act against larger structures while preserving most of their advantages. In CK keeping a large kingdom together for any length of time can a harder accomplishment than conquering the world in a game like EU. It isn???t a detail-oriented simulation like Victoria but it is much more successful at delivering the feel of the era. , September 15 2018, See my full detailed review here: http://www,orr880,a
Beholder," 3.5 stars. That s pretty good actually. You play as a government employee whose job entails keeping an eye on the tenants of the building he s in charge of. The setting is a dystopian one and the game looks accordingly bleak with characters being black shapes and everything looking a bit dark and grey. Graphics are somewhat simplistic but also appealing in a way. Game mechanics are fairly simple: You earn money by installing cameras and microphones in the apartments and selling certain information to your employer - or not. Other means of acquiring wealth include blackmail and theft. Whatever you do don t get caught; wait for tenants to leave sneak into their places ruin their lives - or don t. Some things are a bit annoying like the fact that you have to hurry up to not get caught in your shenanigans or that some things will lead to other terrible things which you may not have any way of telling. Overall Beholder has a vague Papers Please vibe to it and like in that game you can either do your job and not care or do your best to help the people around you all while taking care of your family and trying to keep them alive. I enjoyed this game a lot but I have to say it s a bit of a pain to reach the ""best"" ending since there are very specific requirements for that. There are several choices to make and various different endings to reach however so playing it again is worth it (and recommended since a playthrough can be short or very short depending on your decisions).

Order Of Battle: World War II, Enemy AI is set cheating. It sees position of your troops (without having actual look out / recon there) and play accordingly. For example I just leaved town that I previously defended bc enemy was making no advance and so I made bold move forward but left somewhat little room left on my flank behind - boom enemy will use it and drive straight to the town directly behind your lines - something that normally he would never do. When you move your troops its one way move and thats it - theres no redo. Apparently enemy dont have this restriction so in his turn it says its thinking - it probably doing all those combinations of moves trying out and seeing theres noone in town it choose the most efficent / striking move. Im playing this game for long time and I ve seen this behaviour so many times and its anoying and unrealistic. AI should be oblivious of my move bc it does not had troops around to see it. And yet he did it. Situation like this could be considered fair only if I as well could have this option of redo move just like in other such games (until enemy is spoted). But AI should have this restriction as well so that he could actually drop into traps. Now because of this cheating AI I m looking how remove Fog of War and see all enemy troops on map. Pissed off really. , November 2 2018, Enemy AI is set cheating,spencer,a
Outcast 1.1, Anyone who likes innovative games with unique universe good story and atmosphere - should buy this one. I played it for the first time last year so I have objective and fresh opinion which is not based on 10-15 rose-tinted memories. Considering how old it is it really stands out among its contemporaries. The world in which you find yourself is very alien - and that feeling is conveyed very precisely. The npc s are very human-like yet their culture is quite different from ours. You get involved in solving their problems you learn about their beliefs and all this contributes to making the game a living world. Certainly sometimes it is difficult to find a certain npc and finish their related quests but this should not be a reason to abandon the game. The graphics seem a little bit strange sharp and as far as I remember - a little bit behind the standards of its time but this doesn t matter very much. The world is shaped beautifully and varies from map to map. I strongly recommend searching forums on how to make enemies stronger and player weapons weaker as the game is dis-balanced in that regard. There are a number of very interesting items which allow for different type of game play. You also get to ride and fight on a horse-like creature which adds speed and some definite pleasure in the whole thing. Last but not least - this was one of the best stories in a pc game I personally enjoyed and I still remember some scenes vividly. This game reminds me in its general feeling a little bit of Omikron. Most people who liked Omikron will like this one a lot. , February 28 2018, Anyone who likes innovative games with unique universe good story and atmosphere - should buy this one,burks6704,a

Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation," Ignore the number as that s just so I can actually post my review and people will just only take away the number and skip over all the points I have about the to make about the game/product. This game surprised me with just how strong the visual novel aspect of it was and the gameplay is a 3D turnbased strategy with restricted movement. I was hoping for the game to be a crowd brawler/character action sort of game similar to a senran game but the turn based combat I ve taking a liking to. The RPG elements however not so much. I find myself going through dungeons constantly to level up and grind out side quests just to challenge ""that one boss"" which I find... time consuming and distracting. Plus I was hoping for more BIG ANIME TIDDIES but it s more loli action then I expected though overall I m actually pleasantly surprised with how competent the game is.

Delta Force: Task Force Dagger," Overall feel of this game is - game has been extremly rushed to come to market. DF: Land warrior engine equipped with mix of new and old problems. Triggers (not that mandatory here) dumb AI. I do not really oppose missions on your own here - it s better than problems with your mate played by game s AI. New problems rise here: not clear mission briefings (text-only I really miss the voice of DF:LW) like three waypoints per mission (insertion single WP for all your targets and extraction) not clear voice from command. You ll be surprised how many times you won t be sure what you re suppossed to do. The game is pretty much just DF:LW but without the good feeling. You ll be shooting the very same targets in the very same location all over and over. Underground bunkers and tunnels. Missions ""randomly"" failing: extraction by chopper? Chopper destroyed in about 50% of pulls before you can get yourself to exfil. Stealth mission? Airport security will be alerted while you re more than 1km away from airport. You gotta leave before allied missiles hit the target? First warning is in 15secs. Maps oh the terrain. I think they ran RNG to make 100 maps and took those few that looked not extra bad. Full of copy-paste. Tunnel walls are not aligned to that degree you ll get stuck if you stick yourself to the wall. The plot - while realistic I guess - is on the same level through the game. You won t see any ""progress"". Plot stays static. You re there you do your job you leave. That s it. Where s the tension? Gone. Missions connected by bigger story? Gone. Shoot this don t shoot that blow something up. BUT WHY you want to shout? No questions soldier you ve got your orders. This one s just too expensive even for free. Not worth it s disk space.

Blake Stone: Aliens Of Gold," Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold tinha tudo para ter sido um dos grandes FPS cl??ssicos que todos comentam hoje em dia se n??o fosse por um pequeno detalhe: apenas 1 semana depois do seu lan??amento Doom chegou ao mercado e ofuscou totalmente as previs??es da empresa. Como o jogo ainda utilizava a ""Wolf3D Engine"" e Doom introduziu a nova ""Doom Engine"" poderia-se simplesmente chegar a conclus??o que devido ?? isso o jogo n??o faz frente com o cl??ssico da id Software mas eu concordo em discordar e voc?? vai saber o porqu?? agora. O jogo consiste em 6 epis??dios com 11 fases cada sendo que s??o 9 fases normais e 2 secretas. Um elevador principal conecta os andares 1 ao 10 e ?? o ??nico meio de transporte entre as fases. O objetivo de cada fase ?? ir do andar 1 ao 8 para coletar um Cart??o de Seguran??a Vermelho para desbloquear o pr??ximo andar. Blake pode retornar ao elevador e voltar aos andares anteriores para encontrar itens deixados para tr??s ou matar os inimigos restantes. Apesar da jogabilidade e dos gr??ficos serem bastante similares ?? Wolfenstein 3D a JAM Productions conseguiu expandir as ferramentas gr??ficas e adicionar elementos que deixam os visuais muito mais detalhados do que o cl??ssico da id Software. Na jogabilidade temos 5 armas diferentes que se diferenciam em alcance efici??ncia e dano mas todas utilizam o mesmo tipo de muni????o. Os cen??rios cont??m um n??vel de detalhes muito maior do que Wolf3D e os 6 tipos de inimigos cont??m pelo menos 3 clipes de vozes diferentes. Al??m disso 2 novidades foram adicionadas: ao inv??s de contar apenas com equipamentos de sa??de e comida deixados pelo ch??o ?? poss??vel coletar moedas durante as fases e comprar comida em m??quinas espalhadas pelas fases. A outra novidade ?? a possibilidade de se conversar com os NPCs para obter dicas sobre a fase. No fim do dia ?? um grande jogo que infelizmente foi lan??ado em um momento p??ssimo para a empresa.

Objects In Space, I bought this following a Scott Manley youtube clip mostly because I was a bit bored and looking for something different. It hooked me. I have not played anything like this before but it is just fast paced enough to keep me interested while allowing for a relaxing experience while having a beer and chat. The interface need some usability work like being able to use hotkeys to switch between screens in the same ???room??? or being able to use ship screens while zoomed out. I don t think the tags are accurate - I would say more of a trading simulator than an action stealth game.

Absolver, Immediately I imagine most people are shocked at the 5/5. I have to admit this game is flawed to hell and back (got it on the other worse platform not here sadly). However what the game did right it did very right. The game play is extremely enjoyable. Hunting down mooks and fighting them to learn their moves was a fun way to grow your character. Speaking of having your character grow in moves learned rather than other metrics was also really satisfying. The combat is deep enough to be interesting and gripping but the system of basic/high/low/side/back works really well. The best part about the game is its character customization. The ability to create and refine your own  martial artwas excellent. The method of swapping between stances based on your last move allowed for a lot of weird and wonderful combinations. The fact that most moves can turn into anything keeps you guessing in pvp and makes info gathering and reads really fun. Drunken Fist was annoying though. The bad? It felt like a demo. The PvE while fun is empty and non-existent when it could have been Soulsbourne-esque. If it wasn t going to go for that then it shouldn t have hidden PvP behind campaign completion. You should have just had PvP and the campaign as a separate mini game. Absolver didn t know if it was a Fighting Game or an Action RPG. This KILLED the game because it ended up not being able to call itself either. Amazing potential great experience but you ll be left wanting when you finish and you won t ever come back. , September 26 2018, Immediately I imagine most people are shocked at the 5/5,mercado7519,a

Deep Sky Derelicts," I have to admit that the very positive reviews and the art style that looks similar to Darkest Dungeon made me too impulse buy this. Only to be a little disappointed: The art looks great on a screenshot but just is not as well executed as Darkest Dungeon did it with this art style. The animations just don t work out like they did there. They just feel unfinished and unpolished. The great tension and forceful feeling of DD just isn t there. Then there s the gameplay: It just feels like made from a checklist for ""Hot wo do a Roguelike for Dummies"". Just go to a ""Ship / Derelict"" talk to an NPC get something for them. That s it. That wouldn t be so bad if the fight system would be a thrill. But it isn t. For me it feels more like a chore. Something you have to do not something you enjoy doing like with Darkest Dungeon. The card / deck mechanic felt very interesting and maybe it is but that doesn t make up for the very basic feel everything has. The roster is always limited to your 3 guys and if you want to hire someone else it means: goodbye to one of your team members. So there s no way to have different ""teams"" at your Overall this is not a bad game and I am sure that a lot of people can just come to like it very much. For me it was a disappointment. I expected more depth that s all!

Overload, I wanted to write a long review about Overload how it stays truth to the original Descent from 1995. How they managed to recapture every little bit that you loved while playing it. How they didn t venture into wild gameplay changes and what little they changed made the great game even better... But no all I m gonna write here is that this is the best Descent since 1995. If you liked the original Descent you will love Overload. So is there anything to nick-pick about this game? Well... I d improve the cockpit and make it more like the original with functional displays with middle display showing your ship and its shields etc.. But that is probably it.

Jazzpunk: Director S Cut," Jazzpunk is an aesthetically peculiar title drabbed in  cold warera inspired absurdism that plays out a series of  episodicinteractive narrative setpieces. A lot of the reviews on site praise this game like is compelling; this proved to be nothing further from the truth for me. Believe me I wanted to like this. During the episodes while sometimes you will have a  freedomto explore which is as shallow as a plastic kiddie pool most anything that advances the plot is predetermined such that after a while it feels like you could simply watched someone play the  main threadof the game and fast forwarded the slow and badly paced bits. The easter eggs despite adding welcome novelty roll into an experience that proves rather trite and derivative even while beating up cars may prove satisfying. The absurdity fails to elevate the work to live up to anything remotely climactic which almost seems to have been the goal. Jazzpunk unfortunately amounts to a short inane  wackyadventure that thinks rhetorically asking ""hey do you remember things from between 1992 to 1996?"" like it s going out of style is a substitute for humour and synergy between content and features; it is a lot of empty space with very little to do. The only surprise after a while was that it didn t say ""Information Super Highway"" to death. Since GOG is given to a 5 star system: I give it 1 star for the attempt and the look of the game. I give it 1 more star for oddball appeal which I m no doubt sure is the appeal of the game for most people but I can give no more because; overall the experience proves to be tedious slow boring and without any redeeming qualities to the hashed togeteher elements to satisfy you beyond a veneer of novelty. In short there are far better priced  indiegames worth your time and cash. If you want a pastiche narrative experiment that tries and maybe succeeds but it does so on its own terms so far you can t even tell for sure then this game is for you!

Titan Souls, The game is not for everyone but it does what it want to do. It mixes a Boss Fight Mode with exploration of a very refined world in minimalist-pixel graphic. The world is huge enough there are a pair of enviromental puzzle (much like Zelda you will notice for sure if you played both). I also let a little hint for who wants to buy it: - Don t think the game is really over just beating the final boss the truth will show only if you really find everything that s on your path. That s important because if you don t find everything the finale may be a little disappointing. I liked it because it s a very hardcore game and if yu like to push a little your skills on something different than the usual games this one is optimal (on sale of course). , September 6 2018, The game is not for everyone but it does what it want to do,meyer8059,a

The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky Sc," If you didn t play the first game this game will make no sense it is about the most direct sequel I ve ever played. The plot picks up about 6 hours after the first game ended so if you haven t finished the first game....well you ve been warned. Took me 92 hours to finish completing every quest I could find and exploring pretty thoroughly. If you played the first one you know exactly what you are getting here. Tons of ""flavor"" unique dialogue from virtually NPC (though most of it is filler and not necessary to move the plot along) interesting (if sometimes slow) tactical combat. You will be revisiting the same locations seeing the same people fighting some of the same monsters. If you loved the first game this one will scratch the itch....if you were lukewarm on the first one know that this one is more of the same. The first game is basically an extended introduction to the plot this game is where the story really comes to fruition. It s very clear that the two games were originally meant to be one massive game but it would have come in at 150 hours or more and even I am put off by that kind of commitment. I personally enjoyed the story to this game much more than the first as the stakes are much larger and it really does feel like an epic story of good vs. evil. The combat is exactly the same as the first the only difference being the introduction of ""chain"" attacks which I might have used 10 times total in the entire game. So again if you liked the first game s combat you will enjoy this one. I definitely thought this game was tougher than the first one there are a couple fights (especially towards the end) that are very challenging you will need to maximise your team s skills in order to succeed. The final boss is also much more fulfilling and difficult than the first game in my estimation. It s not a flawless game the plot is a little cliched in spots and your mileage with the character tropes may vary. Also the soundtrack is literally the exact same for 85% of the game so don t expect anything new there. But all in all if you enjoyed the first Trails in the Sky and really want to see what happens after that ridiculous cliffhanger the first game ends on you should probably pick this up and see what happens. 4 stars for being fun but minus 1 for reusing a ton of assets and not exactly expanding on the concepts of the first game.

Furi, I bought Cuphead and Furi together because I felt in a mood and while Cuphead is nearly perfect at what it tries to do Furi is altogether more fun. That s not to say that it isn t without its moments of joypad-crushing frustration but there s a certain balance applied to the gameplay here that makes the battles long and tense but fair. Whereas Cuphead punishes mistakes dearly Furi gives the player a chance to fight their way back from near defeat. Bosses and players have  livesso to speak. Taking away one life changes the way bosses fight but more importantly restores your health and gives you one life back if you ve lost any. You ll always start with less lives than the enemy but if you re down to your last life managing to whip the enemy before he takes the last sliver of health off you can put you back in the fight. In this way battles feel like a tennis match - a to and fro in which a moment of resolve and focus can change the course of the match. It s an excellent decision to have made the game like this and single-handedly turns it into a memorable stand-out. Keep in mind though the battles can be long - up to 20-30 mins or more if you keep going back and forth. But in this each fight feels like an epic struggle. My only regret is that this makes it difficult to simply pick up and play which Cuphead is perfect for. , October 20 2018, I bought Cuphead and Furi together because I felt in a mood and while Cuphead is nearly perfect at what it tries to do Furi is altogether more fun,hardin,a
Big Pharma: Marketing And Malpractice, If you own the main game buying this DLC is a nobrainer.

To tell you one: The most important new feature in my opinion is the ability to set product prices manually and having an active influence on the market.

River City Ransom: Underground, As someone who still plays River City Ransom all the way through a few times a year I can safely tell you this game looks a lot like RCR but plays nothing like it. The beauty of RCR was in its simplicity. There were 2 buttons and it worked fine. . until you accidentally kicked that box at your friend instead of picking it up then it was funny. RCR:Underground tries to meld the new with the old and the result doesn t feel at all like RCR. Now there s a button to pick up items a button to punch a button to kick a button to jump a button to block a button to use special moves a button to eat snacks etc.. They changed the game from a fun and funny casual street brawler into a grindfest with nearly impossible-to-pull-off combos and much less heart. As stated in other reviews the moves list is often incorrect on top of everything else meaning that even if you did manage to pull of the combo it wants you to that may not result in a move at all. The feel of the game is also drastically different. There was some humor and some nods to the old game that I enjoyed but they changed a lot. Instead of bad guys dying after a single well-placed Dragon Kick like in the old game (except for a few of the tougher guys that took 3 or 4) bad guys now take up to 10 special moves a piece to defeat. You ll sometimes end up fighting a single lackey or two for 5 minutes or more. It makes the game artificially longer and just kind of frustrating. I miss the old gangs too the packs of enemies that had a specific gang name and a theme and dressed similar and said particular things. Some were tougher some were sneakier etc. Now you just get a random mish-mash of bad guys thrown at you in every screen. Throw in a map system that doesn t seem to relate to the game world at all and it s just a mess. As a side-scrolling fighting game this one is mediocre. As a River City Ransom sequel (finally after all these years) it s a pretty big disappointment. , June 15 2018, As someone who still plays River City Ransom all the way through a few times a year I can safely tell you this game looks a lot like RCR but plays nothing like it,ayala,a

Beatbuddy: Tale Of The Guardians, I really wanted to like this game but... It isn t a platformer as some say but a side-scrolling action with a silly little story that fits the game nevertheless. Pros: * Fresh promising idea. * Music which isn t just background but indeed a part of the game (every animated thingy produces its own sound/beat). * Smooth movements to the beat eases you into the groove. * Funny and cute environment - even the enemies. * Unlimited lives (this alas is quite necessary see Cons). * Nice to play when you have some minutes to spare. Cons: * Music soon gets repetitive (esp. if you aren t too much into funk/house/dance genres). * Very few hints what you should do next so I often wandered around trying to find what I missed. * You have no control of the camera which is at times quite buggy (pans or zooms-in way too much hiding what you really need to see). * Paralax movement of the background is nice but of the frontmost layer not so much - can block the view of your character. * Though the movements are generaly smooth and groovy controls at times don t work well - esp. when time is limited. * Your character can get stuck on any tiny outcrop in the background which often costs you a life. * Quite a few bugs that can block your further advancement (events don t fire or fire too soon). * Some checkpoints are placed so badly that they save your state just after an event misfired so you ll have to reload the entire level (and lose half an hour or more). * There are long parts without checkpoints that require getting through in limited time - without any mistakes. So when you get stuck even for a second due to bad camera controls or the environment you ll die and have to rinse and repeat at nauseam. This can be very frustrating and is no fun at all. * If a bug+checkpoint occurs *after* you finished such hard part you re screwed. So more cons than pros and rather more frustrating than relaxing I d say. Still overall I give it three stars. , November 21 2016, I really wanted to like this game but,jefferson8435,a

Things that suck? - Bad ai it follows you around in swarming circular patterns and even bumps into you randomly. - Some mission objectives are overly complicated or when you reach them your surrounded by flanks. - Random non important missions feel like a chore sometime. - Constant action might bog some systems down. - Too many things going at times you scrub one end of the map only to realize a different location has taken over. Unless you have a massive fleet you might be at a disadvantage of reach two or three targets at once. - Terrible camera positions I like the choice of having 3rd and 1st person views but ship configurations can make both seem odd at times. Liking riding nose end bullet train or a view covered with a ship so large it blocks out the sun. - Your advantage as a captain actually make you seem invincible at first having four specializations to pick from. What sucks is that it is not across the aboard you have an enemy that just wants to shoot with no other purpose than that. You feel like at times your a special case having specializations the galaxy lacks. - Run n gun vs Texas style hold outs I prefer run n gun but there are some missions that require you to take out larger targets. The defenses can be anywhere from minor to over the top impossible. - Its great to be able to apply decals but not really it seems kind of pointless to me unless they added the ability to actually customize the ships and your fleet. , August 26 2018, Awesome game better than the second one more diverse more open world,mccormick9707,a
Afterlife, I like this game it s where I playing god by building both Heaven and Hell where reward and punishment buildings are very funny(there s reward building that works like MaxisSpore while there s also punishment buildings that mocks Conspiracy Theories and Pseudoscience: Illuminatiland and New Age Hells respectively). roads as umbrella substitute for both Power lines and Water Pipes works best here(definitely better than Simcity 2013 did it) not only electricity here are replaced by something that more capable of making impossible possible (as a resource that works like Electricity/water in Simcity games). and the closest thing to be win condition in this game is building Omnibolges(for hell) and Love Domes(for heaven) though there s also true lose conditions: visited by 4 surfers of apocalypse and EMBO s extinction(latter is either caused by Nuclear War(when EMBOs are still particularly warlike even after reaches nuclear technology level) or Natural causes(much more unlikely unless when cheating)) after all this game might be better if there s also mode of playing as The Powers That Be(aka the mode of terraforming Heaven and Hell aswell Planet where EMBO lives) in addition of playing as Demiurge as Usual , June 25 2017, I like this game it s where I playing god by building both Heaven and Hell where reward and punishment buildings are very funny(there s reward building that works like MaxisSpore while there s also punishment buildings that mocks Conspiracy Theories and Pseudoscience: Illuminatiland and New Age Hells respectively),vasquez,a
Anomaly Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign, This is an okay mobile adaptation of the original Anomaly Warzone game. It provides some alternative challenges to the original while keeping much of the core gameplay the same. The biggest change is the there is no longer the commander unit/hero. This does free the camera from being tethered to him which is a plus. You only have to click on a supply drop to pick it up another plus. The downsides come from this being a port of a mobile adaptation of the game. The icons and text are all oversized for fat-fingered touch-screen controls. You can click some distance from your target and it will still register. This can be annoying on the tactical map changing what you didn t click on. Edge scrolling is gone you must click and drag to scroll. Some of the key controls are missing. Ctrl still opens and closes the tactical map. Spacebar still opens the squad display but doesn t close it. Alt does nothing. You need to click on the icons on the left side of the screen to select an ability and then click somewhere on the map to use it. The game does not pause while you decide where to place it. Overall: get the original it is better. , March 3 2016, This is an okay mobile adaptation of the original Anomaly Warzone game,fleming8924,a
Star Wolves, I still haven t decided if this one or Space Rangers is my favorite game of all. Well other reviews say it all. You need to play this one then Star Wolves Civil War and never play Star Wolves 2. Civil War is good but the freedom of choices was not implemented that well so game should just use the same approach with missions system and not fly where you want. Also there are some good Russian mods that change this one so much that it becomes almost a new game but those mods were never intended to be used with English versions (the game is Russian after all). And max resolution is 1280 but that can be changed easily inside the game folder by editing default.cfg file I think. You can set whatever resolution you like there and game runs smoothly. The game engine is surprisingly stable versatile. , April 13 2018, I still haven t decided if this one or Space Rangers is my favorite game of all,bates4627,a
Stonekeep, It is your basic dungeon crawl with hidden places and fights. Spoiler - When you get to the practice yard put a weight on your mouse and go grab a sandwich and your level with weapons is much better when you come back. I had a lot of fun with the game about 20 years ago but my new computer does not have a cd rom drive so I am picking up some of these classics that have been updated less issues trying to get them to run than from old cd s. It is nice to have the hard copy / book manuals instead of pdf s though. Turn off the lights and enjoy a wonderful dungeon.

Massive Assault," Massive Assault has an interesting approach to combat that differs from normal TBS games in several ways: - units always do a fixed amount of damage even at low health - you cannot move into spaces of units destroyed in that round - first step into an enemry territory gives them money to raise guerillas at the start of their turn - territories free of enemies can build units at the end of your turn - freeing an enemy territory and capturing it s capital gives you a one time resource bonus to buy units All of this allows for some interesting tactics and strategies in both defense and offense and even though the game only has about a dozen units it doesn t feel like it really needs more. Unfortunately the AI seems to be broken. Campaign mode often came up with the message ""This game appear to be broken. Please restore it."" Which I did and the message came again. Then I changed my tactics a bit but to no avail. But when I did something stupid instead the game went on without a problem. By this I surmise that the AI crashes if you stray from the expected path. Therefore I cannot recommend this for the vs. AI gameplay and for multiplayer I would recommend the superior Phantom Renaissance.

Mechoecho, It is short. but what there was i wish there was more of. officially there are 30 levels but at least 3 of them you DON T BUILD ANYTHING. and another 10ish are turorials which you have are told what to do and given a premade design. The psysics are very rigid and snappy and different to what i expexted but i actually ended up really enjoying it and is the reason it is not 1 star. but it doesn t give you a chance to experiment with the ideas and solutions introduced for example in the trailer you see a vehicle grab the top of a wall and flip itself to the other side you let go and drive off. awsome and very fun to do... but that s it you never do that again :( It feels like a demo of a much better game. and if you are here for story. it s quite good but also short :( TO THE DEVELOPER.

Ufo: Aftermath," If you wished that X-Com had dozens more varieties of earth guns in it could be played in real-time to move faster and had way more variety of aliens then this is the game you want to play. It s got various armors and guns that deal and protect against various kinds of damage meaning that your loadout will sometimes be different depending on which enemies you expect to face. It s got a real-time strategic interface that is easy to use and yet provides some tactical challenges (But you have to tell your soldiers to  walkinstead of  runat the beginning of just about every mission). It has a story that is reasonably well fleshed-out and that affects the game events in interesting ways. And your soldiers will gain levels and compentency in different skills that affect their performance (until they die horribly but that s squad tactical games for you!) There s little in this game that makes it stand out except that for years before the new X-COM games this was the only series on the market filling that niche. I had fun playing the whole series a few times and if you like X-COM and other similar games then you ll probably like this one too. Now get out there soldier and kick some alien butt! Pros: Good weapon sound effects weapon and armor variety. Good variety of enemies challenging gameplay that is usually not unfair (except for balloon fish in base missions). Cons: Amateurish voice acting mediocre tutorial no in-game help to speak of soldiers default to ""running"" which is definitely not the most generally useful stance. Lots of missions - pretty grindy in the mid-game.

Hatoful Boyfriend," A zany madcap mostly-light-hearted dating sim for six or seven of the routes; for one of them a horror story; and the last a dark meditation on the nature of love and violence. I enjoyed them all. I particularly appreciated the exploration of various types of love; besides the expected there were the types of non-romantic love that exist between a parent and a child between brothers and between friends. (At least they came up on most routes and were seriously examined on the ""fulfill a promise""/BBL/""Hurtful Boyfriend"" route.) What I found a delightful surprise was the fairly capable heroine. In the few Japanese games I ve played and even in some of the otome games that are Western-made the heroine is usually helpless ditzy and dim. The main reasons I m giving the game four stars instead of five are mechanical. 1. You can t look at a text log or go back a few comments. If you accidentally left clicked before you finished reading a bit of dialog there s no way to see it short of loading a previous save and playing again until you get back to where you missed the comment. 2. You can t save while a choice is on the screen. The game tries to compensate signaling an upcoming choice by making it so you need to click two or three times to get to the choice itself showing that you need to save then... but if you re fast forwarding through a scene there s no pause before a choice. Save often. 3. And if you are replaying the game or a route to see what s different when you ve made different choices there s no ""skip seen"" option. Fast forward always skips the entire scene rather than giving you the option to stop where new content begins. These three things may seem minor to those who aren t used to playing games built with the Ren Py engine but they re features I ve come to rely on. (And since they re things even &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; games do it seems a bizarre lack for a commercial game.)

The Tiny Bang Story," My daughter and I have played many hidden object games over the years. Overall there are few things that the genre in general tries to do differently. The formula is well defined at this point. This is where ""The Tiny Bang Story"" enters from stage left. It is definitely a hidden object game and although the story is functionally nonexistent the puzzles and presentation are just lovely. While the bright colors and generally ""cheerful"" presentation would be great for children to look at do not be fooled. Some of the puzzles are fairly challenging and might not be that easy to solve. If you enjoy hidden object games want to burn around five hours or enjoy playing games with your children then I highly encourage you to give this game a try. You will not be disappointed.

Arcania: Fall Of Setarrif, This game is a terrible conclusion to an otherwise great game series. I was one of the unlucky few who purchased the game for a full price when it was new (disk version). The Gothic series is by no means perfect but it has character and seeing where the story brings you despite the bugs that plagued Gothic 3 I decided to go for Arcania. Big. Mistake. The protagonist is extremely boring and unsympathetic. The story is completely forgettable and the only minor highlights were the appearances of characters from the previous games.

Braid," Many other reviewers have attested to Braid s remarkable thoughtfulness and ingenuity and I wholeheartedly agree with them. But one thing that people often complain about is the lack of replayability inherent in a puzzle game. Well besides the fact that the game is full of hidden art and story subtleties and the fact that there are speedruns and the eight top-secret ***** challenges the PC version of Braid also supports fan mods! I myself am the author of a mod called ""Braid: More Now Than Ever"" which includes new story 60+ new puzzles (a greatest-hits compilation of the very best fan-made puzzles from multiple other mods) and remixed art and music.

Drod: The Second Sky, First let s get the caveat out of the way: if you haven t played Journey to Rooted Hold and The City Beneath you ll be lost both in terms of story and mechanics. The Second Sky is strictly intended for experienced players. So with that out of the way what does TSS offer to someone who s played JtRH and TCB? Quite a bit. The most prominent addition is the new weapons. Five of them to be exact. Each one has different abilities and mechanics for example the staff cannot kill monsters directly and instead must push them onto environmental hazards to kill them. The dagger eschews the usual moving and turning dynamic for a more agile approach killing enemies on the space Beethro steps on and the space in front of that. Each one completely redefines the tactics you need to use and interacts with the other elements in a unique way. The story is also far more prominent than in previous installments. I won t go into detail about it to avoid spoilers but suffice to say it s excellent. However again if you re unfamiliar with the past games nothing will make sense. It assumes knowledge of the events of JtRH and TCB. The level design is also a step up from previous games. These more tightly-crafted rooms require significantly more precision to solve but as a result are even more satisfying to complete. Some of the later levels may border on too difficult but never unfair. Another thing I should point out is the sheer amount of content on offer. While most puzzle games are content with a 6-hour length TSS rivals many RPGs in sheer scale. Reaching the proper ending took me roughly 70 hours (for reference JtRH took me about 30 hours and TCB took me close to 40) and I still have quite a bit left to do mostly the traditional assortment of secret rooms. Overall this is an excellent conclusion to the DROD series but not a starting point. If you re new pick up the 1+2+3 bundle and start with Journey to Rooted Hold. , October 1 2014, First let s get the caveat out of the way: if you haven t played Journey to Rooted Hold and The City Beneath you ll be lost both in terms of story and mechanics,bell9959,a
Blackguards 2, Wow I almost wouldn???t know where to begin??? this is truly a sweet game: To my judgement the story was even more interesting than Blackguards 1. Although simple and relatively short I really liked it. The dialogues were fun and the characters well developed for a relatively short game. The upgrade system was simplified and a couple of the objects of complain from the last title were fixed (or degraded depending on your taste): now there is unlimited equipment and better chances of hitting the enemies. Is like the game was designed with the whole and only purpose of having fun and strategizing during the battles but without having to worry too much about restrictions such as lack of arrows or not having enough AP. Still have to be careful how to spend it though and although equipment was unlimited the money you could earn was not. All this didn???t make it any easier some times some fights were light most you couldn t let your guard down others I had to repeat a couple of times some of them force you stop and think and plan ahead and many others taught me not to give up and fight to the end as it seemed that I was losing horribly just to pull out miraculously at the end. True that there are no guides in the internet (that I could find) but for me this only became a real problem with a certain map that seems a bit buggy and is a very hard fight but in the end this was ok too as it forced me to think harder???. and realize how spoiled we are with guides when things start to go difficult. Initially I was disappointed that the game was a bit short but in the end the lenght felt about perfect and the end gave me a tear. Only thing I would request the development team if there was a next time is to allow us to make the time go faster during the fights this is for when we have eternal strings of enemy turns the wait was a bit despairing some times.

Underrail," I am going to compare this to the Fallout series. This is because this game INVITES such comparison being similar -- even down to perks. First I am stuck in an impossible situation. I m trying to do the ""rob Protectorate warehouse"" mission in Core City. From what I can tell there are two ways to do this. One requires a much higher persuasion than I have. The other way involves going through an area where nearly-invisible monsters attack you and disappear. Without VERY high perception combined with one specific perk you will just die. So I have NO WAY to complete this mission. Nice planning guys. Second you are just thrust into the game. Are you trying to save your vault/village by getting a water chip/GECK? Are you searching for your father? Are you trying to find the man who left you for dead? Nope. If this were real life you have no reason to do anything except use your coin to get drunk. There is no motive that the character has to do any mission other than boredom. We know nothing of the main character s past at all at the beginning no reason to keep going. Also the original Fallout series ran just fine on a 120 MHz Pentium. Despite this having inferior graphics it takes about a minute to start up using my 2.0 GHz AMD A10 processor. Plus when trying to load a game it minimizes itself the first couple of times you click on the ""load game"" button before it lets you actually load. This is annoying. Finally the actual user interface is just kind of a mess: parts of it are just downright confusing. Supposedly you can use an ""omni-tool"" to open and close ventilation covers in order to enter the ventilation system. Open yes. Close I have no idea how to do this. You can also use a crowbar to open them supposedly but I can t figure out how. Also neither good nor bad but this game is more ""realistic"" in many ways than Fallout. Loading up heavy armors reduces your action points. Whether this is good or bad is a matter of opinion. ", September 10 2018, I am going to compare this to the Fallout series,carrillo,a

Bounty Train," Its 2018 now and dispite complaints at release the game still is way too unbalanced to enjoy. Some quests you have to fight like 25 well-trained and uber armed enemies vs 4 (the 4 being you) from both sides while hardly being able to move around. The only way to continue is either win the fight which is almost impossible wnt even after 10 enemies killed you run out of pots and explosives or survive for 15 minutes which is even harder given the massive amount of enemies. And thats s at ""normal"" difficculty. The devs promised to balance the game but apparently they abandoned it instead.

Dungeon Rats, I have spent 50 hours on this game in Murderous Psychopath mode. 28 on my first playground where it was a lot of frustration and anger and then i rage quit. But 2 days later i was back for a 2nd try and i began to understand the mechanics of the game and in only 22 hours i prevailed. It was Really easy on this 2nd try and i created a little guide on my website to beat the Murderous Psychopath difficulty.

Seum: Speedrunners From Hell," This game caught my attention because I ve always loved speedrunning despite not being very good at it so naturally a game marketed to speedrunning would catch my attention. The gameplay is very simplistic. You are given whatever powers you need to complete the level just get to the exit as quick as possible. This is literally it. The fun comes from getting better times on each level which lead to some really interesting moments where you kick yourself for jumping when you probably couldv e just run across a gap. The abilites you get for each level range from reversing gravity to making platforms to setting a spot where you can teleport back to which make levels very puzzle-y and never really feel boring. There s also collectables which the game lets you collect then restart the level while recording that you ve collected it which is a god send since otherwise the locations of these objects pretty much promise that you ll time out of the level since they are either hidden very well or are difficult to get to. The main thing that makes me decrease this review by a star is that not every level is about maximizing your action economy or jumping at the best times or any of the other traditional glitchless speedrun techniques it s about finding what ""breaks"" the level. This could me finding a different path through the level using your powers in an interesting way or simply absuing the tools given to you. For some reason this did not appeal to me as it means that some levels you have to run pretty much ad infinitum to just find the thing that breaks the level. In one such case early on it was a collapsable floor piece you could break that cuts off about 6 seconds of your time. This removed the feeling of speedrunning and starts to feel more like a puzzle game than a platformer. Realistically I give this game a 4.5 but since there isn t a half star function I have to put it at a 4/5. Overall I recommend this game fairly highly.

Eschalon: Book III, Excellent game in its own right and a worthy coda to the Eschalon series. The game itself in terms of game play and game engine utilizes most of the improvements of the second game and further polishes them. The story is great but the game does not hold you by the hand in any way. You are actually going to have t use your head remember what has happened so far and explore as much as possible to make it through. All of the what makes the previous games so special can be found in Book III such as awesome character creation tactical combat an immersive world and a wonderful score. Though the little annoyances from the previous games are also present like that unshakable feeling that your character misses far too much sudden death from unseen traps and back-tracking through expansive wilderness with nothing much in it. Book III also felt a little shorter than the previous games but that might just be my imagination. Bottom line: If you enjoyed the first two games then you will enjoy BOOK III just as much. , June 29 2018, Excellent game in its own right and a worthy coda to the Eschalon series,powers2531,a
Torment: Tides Of Numenera - Legacy Edition Upgrade, This is what you get for over-financing a project way before the job is done. Huge PS:T lover here who backed this by 130???. I really did not expect much but I hoped I would at least like this. I could not finish the game half way through. If you have to try hard to keep your interest in the story characters and the world then there is something terribly wrong with the writing and atmosphere. And it s not like my tastes have changed. I ve played PS:T two years back and I ve been blown away even more than ever before - that s how brilliant the writing and atmosphere was. But I ve approached TTON as a completely standalone piece of art with no association to PS:T. I was thinking that will prevent my disappointment. Boy I was wrong. Actually any resemblance and respect to PS:T is what helps this game to stay above water surface. Otherwise the writing here is just overly complex overly flowery overly mysterious overly abundant and in the end overly unnatural overly soulless and overly boring. I also blame audio management for the lack of atmosphere. I ve written exhaustive letter to devs and they pretty much ignored every single point even clear bug reports. That s what you get for backing. The score is composed.. or better yet the audio mixed and processed in a way that the result sounds very flat and featureless without any noticeable dynamics or remarkable details and memorable moments as it was in PST. Not only it s barely noticeable but during dialogues where you spent over 70% (!) of all time someone decided it would be good idea if the music is all muffled and almost muted. What is the point of musical score when you spent literally hours and days listening to it in this muffled state? The ambience of people in the area is lacking heavily. Something I loved about PST that you could hear and FEEL you are in a city full of people around you. In Tides people are silent. You go in a tavern and the place is more dead &amp; silent than mortuary in PST! , July 1 2017, This is what you get for over-financing a project way before the job is done,levy2109,a

Call Of Cthulhu: Prisoner Of Ice, I ll say I don t have this copy but the original PC release. That said lets go over this.. It is meant to be part of the  Call of Cthulhuseries based heavily on the works of H.P. Lovecraft.. long-time fan of his work I can pretty much say that.. if you removed a couple of names then there is nothing Lovecraft about this. the Call of Cthulhu Series was always a mess which was based on someone having heard a copy of lines and that was it but this is really BAD. So first thing Ignore anything that says it s got any relation to Lovecraft.. and it s a pet peeve I know but can people that want to cash in on his work remember Cthulhu was the Prophet of the Great Old Ones. HE wasn t one of them. And if you are going to quote his work get the quote both right and in context else it s just meaningless. Voice Acting is pretty bad Drawn graphics are good. CGI graphics are... not BAD but the animations and movements are very bad. A lot of the Script doesn t make much sense and can be pretty much contradicting itself. I must give it points for gameplay in that there isn t anything SERIOUSLY wrong with it but it s a case that pretty much the only things you can interact with or look at at things you need. And often they are small and bland so they are hard to see.. just wave your mouse over the screen and you ll probably find more stuff not great for adventure games. Some have said this game has a promising start but then goes down hill.. I m not sure in what way.. The intro can kinda be figured out as to its relationship with the game but it s not a great fit. You start on a sub Monster appears Action right of the batt which does show that this game isn t one about depth or detail. mostly slowly walking around with no regard to 3 dimensional space. By the end of the game well.. I was thinking  Didn t Harlan Ellison write a better version of this?and well if Ellison wrote a version he did right a better version of anything. , October 31 2018, I ll say I don t have this copy but the original PC release,malone3970,a
Din S Curse, Many of the things other reviewers bring up with Din s Curse are accurate. It s a Diablo clone through &amp; through and not a very engaging one if you aren t playing with any of the high-level mechanics on - which I must admit I do not. Do you like Diablo but find the game is too easy? Would you like to lose your shopkeepers out of nowhere? Would you like to play for a few hours only to suddenly lose your quest giver? To the game s credit the game s mechanics are largely customizable - which is very much appreciated. In addition to difficulty levels you can turn invasions on or off. You really can play the game how you want. You can make things very very easy or brutally difficult if you want. But without those high level mechanics there really isn t much to the game. There is a specific way this game was meant to be played and a specific audience this game is for. And unfortunately I am not that kind of player or that audience. When I play a Diablo-style game there are a few things I look for in it. And while there s plenty of point &amp; click action it doesn t feel as good as it does in a lot of other Diablo clones. Which is to say nothing of the presentation which definitely feels rough. I m certainly not a graphics snob but this looks more like a game that was released in 1999 than 2010. However that is kind of hard to fault the game for considering this is clearly an indie title. So bearing that in mind despite how I feel I can t truly say Din s Curse is awful. There are undoubtedly plenty of people who will enjoy what Din s Curse has to offer but sadly I am not one of them. Din s Curse simply does not feel like the polished experience I expect with these types of games. And to be fair that s not necessarily a problem with the game itself because it s very clear some people do enjoy what Din s Curse has to offer. So read some reviews and think about whether or not this is the game for you because it may very well become your favourite. , April 16 2018, Many of the things other reviewers bring up with Din s Curse are accurate,strong4847,a

Rebel Galaxy, This is an Indie Single Player Space Game. I was quite surprised how well it is done. The gameplay really focuses on the fun just like a SP title should do. Just hop in do missions blow stuff up upgrade join factions and fly small and big ships. Awesomely fitting soundtrack. If you just wanna do some relaxing spacefighting without all the tedious things in EVE and without dedicating all your RL to it go for this game. It is not full 3D more like actual ship fighting in the ocean but I totally support that design choice. Overall everything is designed extremely smoothly and if you get the hang of it you can do everything you want really quick so that the time flying and exploring is maximized. The content feels also of the right size not so big that there is an absurd learning curve not too small so it gets boring too quickly. My first playthough lastet 50 hours. Then you can do a at least one replay with the opposite faction if you like to after which you probably will put it aside for a while but the itch might come back a few months later. My experience was also very bug free! This game is everthing it aspires to be. You will get really good light hearted spaceship action for casual play or a few days straight if you totally binch it. , October 29 2018, This is an Indie Single Player Space Game,scott7771,a

Into The Breach, I tried Into the Breach at release and was disappointed. I found it too casual and quite limited in terms of gameplay... I was so wrong :) Later I tried again and still did not get it. But the third time I plunged deeper into the missions. And then I started to discover that the interesting elements of strategy are meant to unfold slowly at a regular pace rewarding the gamer who invests time. Into the Breach is a delicately crafted turn-based strategy game with actual rogue-lite elements. You can feel all the dedication and intelligence from its developers in the way it is subtly balanced and detailed. My only wish would be varying map sizes. And why not a narrative story with a better explained background. Perhaps sometimes in and expansion? (Note: I can t understand how sometimes this game is compared to FTL. They may be from the same developers but I fail to see any other similarity between them.) , October 16 2018, I tried Into the Breach at release and was disappointed,roberts8173,a

Avernum: Escape From The Pit, Turn-based combat. Explore as you want tackle quests in the order you want. Satisfying power progression for characters. It s all here - and not a second of time that could have been spent on gameplay or content has been wasted on making the graphics pretty. Avernum: Escape From The Pit hits a very particular RPG target very precisely. It perfectly delivers a mixture of exploration combat question and talking that s incredibly satisfying for a certain kind of gamer but the graphics and sound are serviceable and no more. But if you come to these kind of RPGs for the satisfaction of clearing maps finishing quests and levelling up you ll have a blast. The story s unique enough to maintain your interest without ever being truly compelling. The writing s good enough to get you to actually read it without ever being noteworthy.

Escape Goat 2," A fantastic game that is a more-than-worthy successor to the original Escape Goat! There are several hats for your goat to wear in-game that diversify the puzzles and allow for far more puzzling elements than just mere platforming (although there is still loads of that). Particularly nice is the addition of ""mutators"" upon completion/collection of sheep orbs that allow you to approach the puzzles - including some that you may not have been able to originally solve! - in new potentially game-breaking ways. It is a nice concession to those of us with bad reflexes old age or just mental fragility. I originally got this on Playstation 4 but vastly prefer the GOG version.

Stardew Valley," I bought Stardew Valley at least at first for my son to play. We got through the first stages of setting up a farm (leave it to him to pick the one with monsters) started farming for a few in-game days then he... asked to play a racing game. A few weeks passed and my wife and I were out of town and I wanted to play something relaxing. Before I knew it I d spent twenty hours on Stardew Valley and grown from a tiny operation to a serious farm pulling in 10000 g a day. Now forty hours in I m nowhere near done building my farm or expanding my business let alone exploring the various relationship possibilities available delving into the caves or unlocking the end-game content. The game just sucks you in and more often than not you ll forget the time while constantly trying to go ""one more day"".

The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Of Cold Steel II, Personally I don???t get the high praises around here???at all. Don???t get me wrong it???s still a good game I loved trails in the sky from beginning to end I never really got the same from trails of cold steel and there are many reasons for it weaker character weaker story and I really don???t think those giant robots work well in this game it s always like someone pushed the stop button to insert a minigame. One of the most annoying things is the constant middle finger the game shows you in regards to the outcome of your fight. After overcoming a strong opponent they stand up you are in trouble and someone leaps to your rescue. If this wasn???t an interactive story/game that would be less of an issue although if you count how often this happens even then it would get old rather fast. You are just robbed of your feeling of accomplishment. The game doesn???t make all that good use of the big cast of characters you have 10 people I used 4 of them since having one strong formation makes things way easier. Near the end of the game I grinded a little more to get them all up to speed which paid of in the 2 occasions you need them. I had some technical issues as well the game crashed every time I use Alysas second S-Craft some fights just give me a black screen my game never spread out over my display staying small in the upper right corner and it just crashed in the middle of my second last quest.

Alan Wake S American Nightmare," This was released as a standalone DLC for the original Alan Wake and was never meant to be an entirely new experience. As for the gameplay if you liked Alan Wake you ll like this. The puzzles can be easier simply because of the scope of the game being significantly smaller but still much larger than The Signal and The Writer; that said it is a direct sequel to The Writer. The name for the episode of Night Springs that you are playing out is called ""The Return"" and is the story being written by Wake at the end of The Writer. It is considered an in-universe spin-off similar to The Signal and The Writer since Wake is trapped in the Dark Place throughout all 3 of them. Worth playing if you enjoyed Alan Wake and it s couple DLC episodes; not a ""sequel"" to the main story so don t expect all the holes to get tied up nicely.

The campaign is just phenomenal with each new mission presenting a new set of challenges. I absolutely love Crusader though it seems like there is a little bit of a secret formula that once discovered will get you pretty far before you have to start adjusting your tactics.

Sphinx And The Cursed Mummy, It s AWESOME that more GameCube/PS2 era platformers are being ported to PC. This game in many ways have lots of the cool aspects of those games It also has some of the absolute worst aspects which is 1. save points miles apart and 2. Super crap unnecessary combat Those two things combined means that instead of just focusing on the nice movement and puzzles you have to slog through extremely samey dull fights that nonetheless have a high chance of killing you and forcing you to redo a huge section. Add to that that animations cutscenes and hey simply traversing the huge maps are all unskippable and very long and it all just starts to grate. Which is a shame as especially the puzzley segments as a mummy are pretty fun and clever with some nice surprises I m not gonna spoil. Simply adding the option to turn on frequent checkpoints or manual saves wherever (which should be toggleable of course for purists) would make this a way smoother experience. If you own a gamepad and you want to relive the exact game you played this is a 5/5. As someone without nostalgia for this particular title it s 3 stars judging this as a game that came out today. , November 21 2017, It s AWESOME that more GameCube/PS2 era platformers are being ported to PC,gilmore,a
Edna & Harvey: The Breakout, Are you ready for a Point-and-Click Adventure with a sense of humor as warped as the artstyle? The writing is pretty solid and the characters are all likable... the ones that are supposed to be anyway. Of course the star of the show is our heroine Edna who I liked from the very beginning. She has a cute voice and speaks with such sincerity that I can t tell if she s being a smartass or if she s actually crazy and I think that was the intent. In some games of the genre it s a chore to look at ever last speck of dust for fear of missing that which lets you move forward but in this just the things that come out of her mouth alone make it a pleasure. Some of the jokes might come across as insensitive about mental health but this isn t the kind of game that wants to make a statement; it wants to make you laugh. As someone who does suffer from illness though I was still able to turn my brain off and laugh along; there s nothing that s outwardly inflammatory but do keep this in mind when considering your purchase. You ll run into some moon logic puzzles for sure but they at least play out in an entertaining way. Fortunately there aren t any real action sequences or anything that can t be circumvented with a walkthrough so frustration will be minimal should you choose to go that route. That said SAVE OFTEN; there are a number of game-breaking glitches that I ran into - very strange ones too - not the least of which is that for my copy at least the end credits never appear. I got to see the last screen and listen to the credits music but no actual credits and the game didn t end and since ALT+F4 doesn t work I had to use Task Manager to exit the game from this. I was still able to get through the game just fine though so it all worked out fine and I m looking forward to playing the sequel. , July 11 2018, Are you ready for a Point-and-Click Adventure with a sense of humor as warped as the artstyle?

Tex Murphy: Under A Killing Moon, Nach dem entt??uschenden Martian Memorandum bin ich froh dass die Serie mit dem dritten Teil wieder auf der Spur ist. Auch ohne nostalgische Bindung konnte mich das Spiel sehr gut unterhalten. Die Idee ein Point &amp; Click-Adventure in 3D-Echtzeit-Umgebungen zu verlagern ist selbst aus heutiger Sicht eine tolle Idee. Ich w??rde mir w??nschen dass der Abwechslung zuliebe weitere Genrevertreter diesen Weg bestreiten. Das Gameplay wurde gl??cklicherweise stark entschlackt so dass die aus Memorandum bekannten St??rfaktoren gr????tenteils entfallen (ja es gibt auch keine permanenten Sackgassen mehr). Die wahren St??rken sind nat??rlich die tollen Charaktere und der Humor die wohl den gr????ten Verdienst am Kultstatus von Under a Killing Moon aufzuweisen haben. Die Story ist gut erinnert mich pers??nlich jedoch wirklich zu sehr an Mean Streets. Einziger richtiger Wermutstropfen ist jedoch die sehr ich wiederhole sehr gew??hnungsbed??rftige Steuerung die selbst nach der Eingew??hnungsphase noch ??u??erst schwammig daherkommt. Solch einen groben Mangel kann ich leider nicht ignorieren und ist hier auch der Hauptgrund daf??r warum ich keine h??here Wertung vergeben m??chte. Dennoch gibt???s von mir eine Kaufempfehlung f??r Adventure-Fans die mal was anderes als das typische 2(5)D-Adventure erleben m??chten! Pro und Kontra: Pro: - gelungene teils schr??ge Charaktere - toller Humor - ungew??hnliches bis heute unverbrauchtes Szenario - 3D-Echtzeit-Grafik statt Renderbilder ist selbst heutzutage noch relativ ungew??hnlich f??r ein Point &amp; Click-Adventure - Spielmechanik und Trial &amp; Error-Aspekt wurde seit Martian Memorandum stark entschlackt - integrierte Help-Funktion - gelungene Gesamtpr??sentation Kontra: - zum Teil recycelte Story (wer Mean Streets gespielt hat erkennt zu viele parallelen) - schwammige Fortbewegung per Maussteuerung die einiges an Eingew??hnungszeit erfordert. - vereinzelt nervige Spielpassagen (Kugelspiel Sicherheitsdrohne und andere) - Pixelhunting - Help-Funktion nicht immer hilfreich - der FMV-Stil ist etwas holprig und generell nicht jedermans Geschmack , June 6 2018, Nach dem entt??uschenden Martian Memorandum bin ich froh dass die Serie mit dem dritten Teil wieder auf der Spur ist,ashley8112,a

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Game Of The Year Edition, I know the title of my review might seem a little headstrong but I stand by it. I avoided the Witcher III for a very long time. As a Fallout fan I was a bit catious of getting into a fantasy game thinking that this would be closer to high fantasy. After seeing constant praises AND the NoClip documentary I decided to jump in. I ve not played any of the Witcher games yet...but I will be after this. The environments are deep and the story is very engaging. While some may like the silent protangonist fully immersed RPG style of Skyrim (which is also great) I actually found myself loving the fact that I am not playing my own character. Geralt is funny tough and has an engaging story. Yes you get to make decisions that guide the story but Geralt and the world of the Witcher are already fleshed out a bit which makes it fun to see how it unfolds. One of my biggest complaints about modern games is the quest grinding. I do not have this issue in Witcher III at all. Yes you may have a mulitple witcher contracts that involve killing a wraith or a forktail but they are all very unqiue. This game feels like a labor of love from CD Projekt because all the quests are so fun and unqiue. I am never bored. Speaking of some other unique items...Gwent. I ve never been into playing games inside games. Like games in GTA or caravan in Fallout NV but Gwent...holy crap. I actually love it and find myself seeking out new merchants to challenge. Who knew a card game in an RPG could be so awesome? The characters and voice acting are both excellent. I find myself invested in the world and actually stress over decisions because I care about the outcome. I love the combat and the game is actually very challenging. I am 72 hours in and not even close to being finished. I ve not even touched the expansions yet and that makes me very happy. I don t want a 30 hour game because this game is so good I want to be able to play it for hundreds of hours. An absolute must buy. , November 2 2018, I know the title of my review might seem a little headstrong but I stand by it,morton9644,a

The Witness," I both love and hate The Witness in equal measure. The design artwork environment and ""feel"" are all excellent - truly a masterpiece. The way it teaches the puzzles without having to resort to words is well thought through even if the puzzles do end up getting somewhat repetitive and tiresome. But the pretentiousness... I can t begin to describe how I hate the game for it. The cage ending and the video ending treat the player with equal contempt. If you want to push a mystical (pseudo-Buddhist) view - sure go ahead but don t mix that with a game concept like this. I don t regret the first 50-75% of the time I spent playing the game. I was in awe of the concept. I regret having worked out the ""point"" of the game because that spoiled it for me. For another game with a similarly immersive feel but with some plot go for Quern.

Lake Ridden, Played this game via my steam account. Would have prefered to get it on GOG thought. Mainly because of DRM. The game itself has some excellent puzzles. At first I thought they were easy but then they started to vary in difficulty and scope. I work as a programmer and I had a lot of help from my proffesional experience in this game. For some of the puzzles I had to exit the game and come back a bit later. With a blank slate on my thinking process. , October 30 2018, Played this game via my steam account,love,a
Overfall," This is a highly enjoyable game. Much more than I expected it to be. But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect. So I will mention them first: Undoubtly the most annoying one is the fact that there is no ""save""! Not even ""quicksave"" or ""save points"". You just pick up from where you left when you last exited the game. This means that 1. if you lose a battle you have to go all over again from the start! 2. you don  t get the chance to see where different decisions or choices in a situation could lead you (and there are plenty of them). Other minor complains is that the animation during the battle could have been a bit more realistic (even the archers don  t look at the direction they shoot). But it is somehow still fun though and enjoyable and it doesn  t affect the gameplay at all. Another thing that could have been improved is the (no) choice of characters when you start the game. Fans of ""character customizing"" (like me) will be greatly dissapointed. You just get the same 2 heroes with the same strengths and weaknesses. You can only choose 3 secondary characteristics out of 4 or 5 and... that  s all you can do. Pitty. More choices (if not on the characters at least on their characteristics or weapons) could have boosted the replayability of the game. On the other hand now... (we are getting to the positive things) you do get a vast majority of really diverse companions to choose from when the time comes. More than any other similar game I can think of. The stories are interesting and different enough (although some get a bit repetative - especially since without a save mode you start over the game too many times). And some are really FUNNY. And with some hints for the modern times (e.g. those with the bards and musicians). The combat system seems a bit strange at first but it can be easily learned and takes a bit more time to master. Not hugely deep though. Still simple enjoyable and with a lot of variations. All in all... this is a greatly enjoyable game heartly recomended really funny at some points with its only real disappointment (but a big one) being its lack of saving mode.

Baseball Stars 2, Terrific game. Lots of fun playing. However there is one huge problem with this game. NO SAVE FUNCTION! You could save the original NEO GEO game if you had a memory card.

An entire season to complete can take hours and hours. I am just expected to leave the game running in the background if i want to complete a season? Besides that one massive gripe.

8-Bit Armies - Guardians Campaign, On my side I downloaded the games through in my library under the tab of the original game like any DLC by other games.

Atlantic Fleet," I simply loved turn-based games because such allowed me to think things through instead of quick switching reflex from that mistakenly labeled as RTS. It is really hard to find good turn-based naval games and Atlantic Fleet quenched my thirst momentary for this genre. I really wish GOG would be able to add to their selection the various versions of  Harpoonthe classic of classics of naval warfare. Well my biggest complain for Atlantic Fleet was the fact that all the numeric text used for the various gunnery elevations degrees for steering and such were in blockish SMALL font and with very and I meant VERY low contracts to their backgrounds. The numbers representing fuzzy increments were so hard to identify I couldn t make out if the number between 20 and 40 was 30 or 35 as before 20 increments were marked in 5s but it appeared after 30 the numbers jumped to 40 and so on. Of course I could not be sure as I couldn t make out the numbers represented and here I am using 1920x1080 monitor resolution already! I have mistaken numbers quiet often and ended up firing my guns into empty plots of water! Very frustrating that but a simple GUI improvement could have fixed. How about just a small numeric counter by the side to actually show the elevation adjustment!!!? Or even just a bigger real estate for that gunnery elevation slider? While the gunnery combat was acceptable- other than the aforementioned hard to read numbers aerial bombing and strafing were outright cruel in execution! OK so the launching and flying the planes to the targeted ships were simplified and automated but once there the DIVING to attack and the actual BOMBing attack were all just guess works! There were no crosshairs whatsoever as in real gun sights or bomb sights to aid in the attack; I simply get a third person view of the tail end of the attacking plane and guess at when to dive and when to press the  bombbutton! The designers could have at least added some cruel sighting system to make that part of the game a bit more involving. Granted that aerial attacks were much faster than ship-to-ship combats maybe an added aerial attack phase could be added to at least allow the player to steer the attacking plane UP DOWN LEFT or RIGHT while it is flying forward toward the target- even if it is in shorter turn-based increments! I believe the aerial portion of Atlantic Fleet was the less rewarding of the game. Overall Atlantic Fleet does have it faults but hey it s one of the very few out there for now. I am hoping counting on Killerfish would either release a patch to fix these or would add those suggested features into the next version. And my final hope would be for Killerfish to somehow add this engine to portrait modern naval warfare a la Red Storm Rising and Harpoon!!! So instead of gunnery with 4"" guns replace such with missiles and radars and jamming etc. Now that would be a real Killer!

Immortal Planet, Immortal Planet is an amazing isometric ???Soulslike??? in a sci-fi setting. If you ve played Dark Souls and some of the already existing Soulslikes (for example: Lords of the Fallen or Salt and Sanctuary) you will immediatly feel at home in this game. For those of you who don t know what ???Soulslike??? means: it is a term to describe games that share similar gameplay with Dark Souls. That gameplay consists of: - RPG mechanics (stats of character/weapons matter a lot). But Soulslikes being RPGs does not mean that there is heavy emphasis on story (Storytelling tends to be minimal in those games). Also there are no dialog options/choice&amp;consequence. So they could be described as a more complex Action-RPG. - A grim interconnected (sort of) open world with many shortcuts. - A special saving system in which you manually save your progress in the game at a certain place and when you ve died you start from the last savepoint. - Tough bossfights and even standard enemies can be more difficult than bosses in other games like Skyrim or any other popular mainstream RPG. - You are going to die quite often and upon dying you are going to lose your experience but you are able to get it back. Unless you die a second time before retrieving your lost xp (assuming that this is also the case with Immortal Planet; I ve not died twice yet). - Stamina managment in combat and timing your attacks; also rolling/dashing to evade incoming attacks. So this list shows you what to expect from Immortal Planet because it fulfills each and every of those ???requirements??? to make it a Soulslike. You just have to know what you get when buying this kind of game and you will have lots of fun with Immortal Planet. This is not your average ARPG like Diablo or Grim Dawn. I personally like Immortal Planet very much and I can heartily recommend it to any fan of Dark Souls.

Golem," I just finished the game and while I was amazed with most levels especially the last ones I did not enjoy very much - mostly because of the mechanics and the bugs I experienced later (though saving and loading fixed these). You control a character and you try to reach the exit of each level. While doing so you will have to push some levers turn some wheels and simply try to figure out what you ll have to do to reach the exit. Trying to figure out what the actual puzzle even is reminded me much of Myst. After finding out what to do the solution often is not that hard. The special twist here is that you have to use the abilities of your Golem companion and these do change every few levels so you ll need to adjust the way you are solving the puzzles the game throws at you every now and then. In most cases those Golem updates are really helpful and fun but there is especially one level (L8) were you ll have to walk a lot to find the correct way and while the path finding routines are not optimal also your Golem is not the fastest one. Keep in mind that there s a fast forward function (pressing space)! The implementation of the last ability of the Golem - move rocks - sounds fun but I found myself often fighting with the physics engine the game uses here to an extreme and don t even mention the automatic zoom while I try to zoom out and the game decides for me to zoom in after a while. The Story is not special at all so don t expect too much in this regard. Also there s no lore to find. This is first and foremost a puzzle game and you should not expect much more. The part ""Decipher the tower s cryptic pictographs to find clues to its ancient builders and the origins of the mysterious golem."" listed under features on the gamecard is simply misleading. If you are interested because of the puzzles or the artstyle however I can recommend this game despite the flaws in the mechanics in the last three levels. I enjoyed my 10 hours trip with the Golem.

Noctropolis," MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDED. As a rule I don t play adventure games more than once because commonly there s little point... and click (:D): when you know the answers to puzzles there s no challenge the story is generally the same and so on. Few of these games present the world wonderfully enough to inspire ""another go"" at least at first (""Machinarium"" comes to mind) but even if I really like the game itself I rarely return to titles in this genre. ""Noctropolis"" is a weird mix: on one hand it has TREMENDOUS potential (especially during today s hype for superhero fiction): the intro shows your avatar reading old ""Darksheer"" comics setting the mood and characters of the story that s about to unfold. The premise is simple - you re sucked into the world of the comic (think ""Toonstruck"") Noctropolis and become the new Darksheer when the original protector of the city decides to retire. An unusual concept for an adventure game (which are commonly less dynamic) so if you like superhero genre you re probably sold. In the meantime a mysterious figure gathers a group of supervillains to terrorize the city and by all accounts your mission will be to stop them... and this is where the good first impression takes a devestating blow. Quite honestly there isn t really a set goal for the whole adventure - sure bad guys are loose but you re never directly told that you have to stop them and in fact when the game ends many of these villains are STILL on the loose. Add to it that for a substitute hero you don t really defeat any of the villains you encounter (with one clear exception) and the whole premise of the game being a superhero genre is practically tossed out the window. The game DOESN T wrap its own story (and its ending is rather disapointing too). The puzzles are rarely hard and quite often they re just so painfully simple that you don t feel like you really achieved anything by completing them nor the game itself. The background graphics are good and set the tone of the story well but story itself is very lacking with little ""cause and effect"" mechanics actually implemented; a feeling that the game is just a bunch of episodes tied together by characters only is not unusual for ""Noctropolis"". Yes there is nudity in the game - literally a single scene of it by my recollection and the fact that throughout the game you run into two females designed to be sexy (Stilleto and Succubus) one of which will be your sidekick for most of the game. All of this is sad because most of the villains had potential to be very interesting and I wouldn t mind seeing a superhero who defeats enemies with his wit and brains rather than brawns. Sadly most characters are not elaborated on at all and as I mentioned you don t really get to defeat the villains. It s fun to experience ""Noctropolis"" for the sake of the atmosphere but frankly I think watching a playthrough video will suffice for that - adventure game fans will probably be dissatisfied with rather easy riddles and the story just isn t solid enough to care the game. I m sorry; I really wish I could claim ""Noctropolis"" to be a great game but I just don t think that it is. ", April 29 2018, MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDED,navarro3862,a

Hollow Knight - Official Soundtrack, I fucking hate this game. That sorta hatred you only get from something that is incredibly viciously cruel and punishing and downright sadistic in design. You can go a number of hours in the beginning without feeling this hatred and you ll be forgiven for it. It starts off quite mildly. But the further you go along in this journey to fucking hell you find that all the things you have ever hated ever have been compiled by two fucking sadists into this game. And yet I fucking love this game. Forgive the excess in F bombs but this game brings that out of me. It is masterfully done beautiful and elegant tight in its controls and intriguing in its lore and story. I can t wait to play it when I m not in my leisure hours and everytime I start the game I feel something warm and fuzzy inside. And then that feeling turns right back into hatred and vile rage. Because for some reason they saw it fit to make this game the most punishing thing you ll ever play (this is an exaggeration but go with it). Why are there so few save points. Why are you punished so hard for failing such hardcore platforming and such tanky and difficult bosses? Why must I traverse the map countless times back to the place I just died only to redo it a few seconds later because YEAH I FUCKING DIED AGAIN!? None of it matters because this game is the best game ever. I know it s an exaggeration go with it!!

No Man S Sky," While No Man s Sky might have improved significantly since its release it s a shame that there is still no Multiplayer support for the GOG version. When the NEXT update was released in July 2018 multiplayer was introduced in the Steam version of the game for GOG it was promised ""later this year"". Now after the next update ""The Abyss"" MP is still lacking from the GOG version. Thus a negative review from my side simply because the game is not ""complete"" on GOG.

Blocks That Matter, I ve finished adventure mode with most stars and all chests and solved most of the bonus levels. Since the rest is only frustrating and no fun anymore I consider it finished. The art is minimalistic as can be expected from a Java game the music is relaxing and it should be because the game can be really frustrating when you have planned out your solution reached a certain point after some difficult moves but a tiny mistake in timing let s you play the whole level again... and again... I ve enjoyed the game anyway and would recommend it to everyone that likes puzzle games and doesn t mind all the areas where you need perfect timing and perfect jumps.

Staxel," Currently it s Minecraft without the monsters or boundless worlds Harvest Moon without the relationships or time crunch and Cube World without the combat or progression. The game appears cute there s plenty to interact with and you can build any sort of blocky structure you wish in an optional creative mode but it s ultimately an empty grind without any real push or purpose. There is little strategy to farming and much of it just comes down to holding the action button for a little while then waiting for the day to end in boredom. After you ve run around the island once you ve seen everything the game has to offer. A long-dormant mineshaft? Pretty but nothing to it. Mysterious abandoned houses with candles and fireplaces alite? Mere props to disassemble. An ocean of possibilities surrounding you? It s only waist deep. Characters repeat the same dialog every day and many (such as the shopkeeps in the marketplace) don t have any characterization and are clones of each other. Some will requisition you to build various things for them such as new functional structures like a museum or bakery but considering the sheer workload involved with procuring and then refining resources to complete them makes these requests feel monumental and unwelcome. The amount of time it would take to construct something like the prebuilt town hall or fairy manor? Hours in creative mode days in the grind. Coupled with the fidgety UI and unintuitive method you re to gain the blueprints necessary to complete the projects the tasks are not at all enticing. The reward: an NPC with nothing interesting to say will sometimes decide to momentarily sit inside and do precisely nothing. I m doubtful that Staxel was fleshed out before it was pushed out and the slow updates with focus on ""bugfixing"" and ""refinement"" (as opposed to prototyping new interactivity and content) strongly indicates that the developer has no plans to make a more engaging experience than what s already here.

Sunrider Academy, I don t usually play dating sims but this was 2 bucks. I don t think it s worth your time. I played through on the Sonya story line. Pretty boring and essentially nothing happened. If your character wasn t in the game the NPC s would all have the same fate. You play for 9 months in the game. After month 3 would have been a better stopping point. After you get all the hearts up on the girls in the first couple months you just click through the same conversation with your sister for the next 6 months.

Project Hospital, I ll start out by saying that I was pretty astonished by how negative the initial reviews here are of this game often just harping on a few specific flaws and slamming it with one star without even the pretense of nuance or you know actually telling people how the game plays which might actually give them an idea of whether or not they might like the game. This is really par for the course for most user reviews and I won t deny that for quite a few people the flaws (and the premise) of this game will be an instant turn-off but in this case I think the reviews really do a disservice to any potential players and to what I have found to be - despite its flaws - a really unique and detailed hospital simulator. I ll start with the bad. This game has: - no rebindable keys (though I can t recall ever using any keybinds to begin with) - a very limited options menu - a buggy (but completeable) tutorial - very few missions - no camera rotation - a bad ui - a limited soundtrack - an occasionally frustrating ai which doesn t respond quickly to player input - a pretty slow pace and later on once you ve figured the game out - not a whole lot of challenge or variety So with all these flaws why in the world am I giving it four stars? Because I ve played it for several days now and still want more. While this isn t the first hospital simulator ever made or even the first recent one it is definitely the first one I ve seen with this level of authenticity flexibility of playstyle and attention to detail. Unlike say Theme Hospital all of the conditions symptoms and medical procedures are based on reality and rendered in excruciating detail and the game makes a big deal out of letting you engage with all these things yourself if you want or ignore them if you don t. The game really is a hospital SIMULATOR and like many simulators it is janky as shit. Turns out that is exactly what I want and if that s what you want as well then check it out. , November 3 2018, I ll start out by saying that I was pretty astonished by how negative the initial reviews here are of this game often just harping on a few specific flaws and slamming it with one star without even the pretense of nuance or you know actually telling people how the game plays which might actually give them an idea of whether or not they might like the game,rosa,a
We Are The Dwarves, Umm look missteps here are aplenty way more than a short review can fit in. The baseline of my impressions ??? We Are the Dwarves may be a functioning product but it s not a finished game. Every aspect here needs varying degrees of work: core mechanics and UI are a couple of prototyping/itirating cycles away from gelling together QA-wise it looks like a few months of polish to go and in terms of content it s all over the place with relatively huge setpieces quickly discarded while some environments get recycled from start to an abrupt ending. It never feels that the devs found their footing with the overall design so it thrashes between a mostly by-the-numbers ability-based action a few one-note gimmicks and a clunky real-time squad tactics. I ve enjoyed its aesthetics and some of its gameplay quirks but rather in spite of its more glaring ever-present flaws. Can t say the latter won t outweigh the rest for everyone else. , October 30 2018, Umm look missteps here are aplenty way more than a short review can fit in,carlson,a

Serial Cleaner, Bought that game on an impulse because it was 75% discounted (cost me 5???) and trailer showed an original artstyle alongside a funky vibe to the game. Unfortunately behind the curtains the game is really blank. Starting with the good points of the game the soundtrack is really cool and does a great job of setting a funky 70s touch to the game. The artstyle is minimalist and original also playing a big role in setting this cartoon and funk aspect but I can t help but feel that they could have pushed further in this artistic direction and add a bit of polish. Now with the bad points gameplay is the key problem according to me. The game feels really systemic and game mechanics are nothing but classic and well worned action-stealth mechanics. Detection is a simple on/off your goal is simply to reach points and come back with the bodies picking up items andc cleaning blood on your way very basic all in all. The real problem for me is the guardsAI they are simply dumb as bricks. If only it was a sacrifice made for the sake of interesting gameplay but no you can hiode in front of them and just wait for them to go away they don t notice the bodies gone away or the body bags dropped on the floor all this leading to very blank and boring levels. I don t know if the game adds new mechanics and more level design opportunities later on I dropped after about 2h in and don t feel like pushing further so I can t judge the bonus levels and end game content. Finally I told at the start that I had this game for 5??? in discount but I really think this game should not be sold for more than that. , June 9 2018, Bought that game on an impulse because it was 75% discounted (cost me 5???) and trailer showed an original artstyle alongside a funky vibe to the game,castaneda,a

Galak-Z," Galak-Z is a fun shooter that feels like a cross between Asteroids and Subspace. Gameplay is straightforward just blow up everything your path. Visually everything looks fluid and has a very ""Star Blazers"" or ""Captain Harlock"" vibe. Music is standard fare and fits the tone of the game. Characters and story are generic and forgettable which is fine for a pure action game like this. Originally I tried to play this with my gamepad but found it very cumbersome. When I switched to keyboard and mouse control became much easier and more precise. This is a game that would highly benefit from Robotron 2084/Smash TV style controls for gamepads. Overall I am having fun playing Galak-Z. It s not a great game but it s worth a play if you like shooters and old-school 1970s Japanimation.

Call Of Cthulhu: Shadow Of The Comet, I m not usually play a point n click adventures but now I decided as it s based on Lovecraft. This game is very climatic and gives you 1001 possibilities to die (by cultists The Old Ones or simple traps). If you are not familiar with this kind of game I recommend a reading partially walkthrough when you stuck (and believe me - it s VERY easy). Despite the game has a great scenario and atmosphere it has a very diffucult controls and sometimes the usage of character skills is not triggering correctly (sometimes I couldn t look on the certain item/object because character stayed the one pixel from the border). I think that this game need to be remastered when the horrible controls will be fixed and music and graphic would be improved - then I could easily give a 5/5. , April 15 2018, I m not usually play a point n click adventures but now I decided as it s based on Lovecraft,castro3524,a

Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun, Here s what s good: the graphics (and art style) the voice acting the puzzles the gameplay (especially as you get further in) and its stability (no issues). Less than good is: the story (a bit thin and cliche) the load times (painfully long) the default keybinds (feels like a mess - though all of them can be remaped thankfully) and while multiple approaches to each map is valid there is a feeling of having to connect the dots and find the exact right guard to start with. Some may enjoy this for me it was a bit of mix. Sometimes I didn t mind at others it felt like a drag and I wished there was more consistent gameplay flow without needing to wait for vision cones to disappear and constantly reload a previous save to get past a section. Conclusion: there s a lot to be admired at how well polished and solid much of this game is. If there s another iteration of Shadow Tactics it could be a classic. With this initial entry you may end up with some grievances but overall it s hard to argue that it s not a worthwhile experience if stealth gameplay strategy and puzzles are your thing. If you re on the fence wait for a sale and you ll more than likely be satisfied. , October 15 2018, Here s what s good: the graphics (and art style) the voice acting the puzzles the gameplay (especially as you get further in) and its stability (no issues),medina4074,a

Hearthlands, Unexpectedly good. This is a city builder with walkers similar to the old Impressions games. Zone out housing provide food beer medicine and manufactured goods to make them evolve. Evolved houses send out cosmetic walkers dressed up in better and better clothes. More citizens means more money which you need to upkeep your troops. You need troops to defend your city against on map monsters and periodic invasions from neighbors. Send yours squads of archers and war pigs out against other cities to vassalize them and obtain tribute. Efficient supply chain management is a must. I only can eke out wins on the normal difficulty but some have optimized it to be able to defeat it on the hardest difficulty. Don t be put off by the kiddy graphics. This is not a easy kids game. This is a hard core city builder probably on par with the harder provinces in the Impression city builder games. You will be well rewarded with a deep and exciting game. I like fights in my city builder and this provides it in spades. For added bonus and replayability the maps are randomly generated rivals as well. You also get to play as 4 different cultures each which play very differently. My favourite are the Russian themed Easterners who eat sausages drink cider and breed war pigs for war pig rider mounted archers. They also get more labor out of their citizens. Northerners are Viking themed Southerners seem Greek or Byzantine (wine drinkers) westerners get Wizards and eat Bread. Also any game with pigs gets a plus from me. These are some cute pink cartoon pigs from the farms. In short don t let the kiddy graphics fool you this is a challenging and rewarding city builder with a lot of fights. Closest similar game would be Knights and Merchants (also has pigs!) although the spell nuking seems similar to the nukes in Majesty. , October 5 2018, Unexpectedly good,cline,a

Darkstone, I was looking through my older games and came across this one. What a blast I had when this first came out. I played it incessantly. Because you an replay the same character over and over retaining all the levels from the previous game I managed to get my character up to a ridiculous level 85. The exploring and combat are all fast-paced and though the game has commonalities from one iteration to another (obviously the town setting and final boss fight are always the same) the dungeons themselves are randomly selected for each game. Sure it s a Diablo-like game but that s a good thing. Truly a good old game. , October 15 2018, I was looking through my older games and came across this one,ortega,a
Post Mortem, One on side I liked this game. I played it after Still Life and it s definitely better than the crap that Still Life 2 was in some aspects. The atmosphere was nice I liked that you could do the same thing by following different paths (also replay value) I liked the main character. Some people complained about the gameplay but I didn t think it was bad. My main issue is the plot: it starts out with a nice premise and mystery (you are hired to investigate a gruesome homicide by a mysterious woman) but little by little the plot becomes less and less believable and the ending was just... Meh. I don t mind the supernatural being involved but I felt that in this case it was just put there cos it was the only explanation possible does it make sense? The dialogues also didn t make sense sometimes the sequence of the conversation was all over the place and you had to repeat similar lines twice or it wasn t clear how different lines lead to different results. The puzzles had me stuck in a few places but I thought some of them were quite interesting. All in all I would grab it on sale and for one dollar it s definitely worth the price - you can expect less than Still Life but better than Still Life 2! , September 26 2018, One on side I liked this game,alvarado7297,a

Tetrobot And Co., This is a great puzzle game if you like doing puzzles then you will enjoy this game.. I would strongly agree with a few other who say this is the best puzzle game in a few years..

Timespinner, The art and animation is fantastic the platforming and controls are super tight and it s an overall very solid Metroidvania game. So why did I rate it 3 stars? 1. The time stopping mechanic that the game is named after is barely used. You have access to it from the very beginning of the game but about 90% of your uses for it occur in the first 2-3 areas. After that you ll very rarely be presented with a puzzle that requires you to briefly use it to get access to an otherwise unreachable area (but even then you get a double jump later that renders it almost entirely moot). You can t damage enemies when time is stopped so it s not useful in combat other than to dodge a projectile or something but enemies telegraph their moves pretty blatantly so I never needed to do that. 2. You can switch between a lot of different types of weapons which level up as you use them but realistically you re just going to pick the one you like the best and use it for the whole game. Each has its own damage type and each of the 80 enemies in the game has their own resistances and vulnerabilities but it doesn t make enough of a difference to bother swapping loadouts. 3. The game is very short. I achieved 100% completion in about 15 hours. You could finish the game in much less time than that and still get the best ending. 4. It s too easy unless you use the most extreme difficulty option but you ll have to complete the game at least once to unlock it. Unless you re hardcore in love with the experience you re probably not going to go through that again. It would be nice if that difficulty were available from the beginning because I think it s a more appropriate challenge for experienced genre fans. Boss fights don t demand much strategy other than spamming your attacks or spells. You can access the inventory at any time (which pauses the game) and chug healing items to your heart s content. I almost never had to use a healing item in the entire game though. , October 16 2018, The art and animation is fantastic the platforming and controls are super tight and it s an overall very solid Metroidvania game,daniel909,a

Kingdom: The Far Reaches, There sure are a lot of nay-sayers for this game but implore you not to listen to them. I ve beaten this game numerous times and it s not as hard as people are implying. Yes you do die a lot but you re supposed to. Death is part of the game. That s why every death gets its own animation and most of them are voice-acted! Yes there are limited lives but that s what re-loading your save is for (and you should be saving often). Experimenting with scenes that can either kill you or cost you items should be your goal not something you avoid. But apart from that everything else in this game is great. The fully-voiced animated cutscenes that accompany every single area a gorgeous leitmotif-style soundtrack and a classic fantasy feel that s sure to give some Lord of the Rings or D&amp;D vibes. This is like a point-and-click adventure version of Dragon s Lair. My only gripe with the game is that some of the voices are hard to understand but it s a really old game so that s to be expected. , October 8 2018, There sure are a lot of nay-sayers for this game but implore you not to listen to them,irwin,a
Heroes Of Annihilated Empires," Well it didnt work. This game has some nice ideas most time terribly executed. You have plenty of units with plenty of abilities lot of different potions lot of everything. But thats just it - lot of everything. You run over map full of enemies of all sizes shapes and colors just raining death upon them. If you use your ranger otherwise they rain death upon your poor fragile troops. Lucky thing is your ranger can kill thousands of enemies without even get tired. Dialogs are long (because hero all the time repeats same things) and almost stupid. What is happening doesnt make much sense. Finding broken giant fighter aircrafts and broken giant tanks scattered randomly over hills doesnt help much. Maps are full of creatures that almost exclusively want to kill you and will charge you and die under rain of arrows. That is what you do most of game. Rest you slash them with sword. Sometimes there is some hidden sidequest and treasures. Beware - you may play any map from campaign you already played - but you lose progress you made starting without levels equip and so. That means - you hero is toasted. BTW while its caled ""Heroes"" you actually play one hero. And sometimes his future girlfriend. But she tends to lost stuff you give here and because she is not so often in game her level is low and will not help much. As I mentioned at start there is some good ideas. For example if you kill goblin leader goblins will scatter and run for while. You may also want to take down leaders of any other tribe because they gives their tribe bonuses. That is fine. Less fine is you may encounter tribes where is every second member chiefant. You will encounter all that ideas in first 10 missions. Then its all about slaying (literally) thousands of enemies with single hero. Buy it if you are looking for something really weird ", December 15 2017, Well it didnt work,harrison8309,a
Attack Of The Earthlings," I just finished the game. It was entertaining enough for the most part. Humans invade with a strip mining ship that is run by a corporation with all the tropes associated with corporations. There are 7 levels for the ship that you have to clear from the bottom to the top. As you progress the humans get new types of units and you get/upgrade to new type of units. I should mention that while this game is turn based and labeled as strategy I found it more similar to a puzzle game. Enemies have 25 hp your unit deals 25 damage enemies get a unit with 35 hp you get a unit that deals 35 damage they get a unit with armor you get one that can bypass armor they get a unit that explodes on death you get a range unit. So it s more about solving a puzzle by finding the scissors to their paper less a strategy. Apart from matching your units to the enemy part of the gameplay is based on stealth. Since most of your units can die in one hit you will have to sneak around and plan your moves. You gain points after each level based on your performance. You get less or more points based on your performance if you lost units killed more humans took less or more turns than expected finish extra objectives. In between levels you can unlock different upgrade to your units using those points. Before each level you can respec freely. Overall the game was entertaining without requiring a huge investment of time and ""skill"". I easily finished all levels (with some loading - as I said it s more of a puzzle than tactics game). The game took about 10 hours to finish and by the last level I was growing bored. I m happy it did not overstay it s welcome. ", March 20 2018, I just finished the game,kramer,a

For The King," I ve played this game about a year now ive put 100 s of hours into it and its great fun its especially if you enjoy Couch coop or online coop. Its a mash up between rogue like and board games if you have ever played zombicide or similar coop tabletop games you ll enjoy it.

Dustforce Dx, Dustforce DX is a great game. You go around cleaning with acrobatic janitors. Lack of story isn t really a big issue and neither is difficulty. The problem lies with its controls. Even after playing it for at least an hour the controls still don t feel second nature. As someone has already pointed out this game is incredibly floaty. There s nothing to fix the sensitivity. Apart from this its a good buy. A must for speed runners or hardcore platformer fans but will be a hard time for anybody else. , September 23 2017, Dustforce DX is a great game,pickett2806,a
Synthetik: Legion Rising, Played a lot in 7 version of game: great roguelite experience as designed. Lots of weapons unpredictable runs nice balance. This version was very fun and promising. And then... version 9 came out. It broke everything: player skills were nerfed to the floor enemy stats were raised to the skies. Swarms of overpowered enemies no loot drops (not even a chance of it) and very weak android against it all - no fun at all. Played a lot with a sniper class: now sniper shoots like a drunkyard - no normal headshots no way to make a tactic runaway because of overpowered enemies. I don t want to play such unpredictable game: it s not an MMO which income depends on game balance it s just another premium game. I don t understand why developers made such a mess with new updates. , October 29 2018, Played a lot in 7 version of game: great roguelite experience as designed,dalton,a
A Hat In Time - Seal The Deal, I enjoyed this DLC! For $5 it provides a lot of content. Though the Arctic Cruise chapter is shorter than other chapters in the game it s densely packed and a lot of fun to explore and run around in. It s a bit more difficult than the base game especially the second act which has a timed element but I d say it s still lenient. Death Wish will be where most of your time is spent. It s essentially a challenge mode: while it adds some unique levels it s primarily existing levels with some added challenge or passive contracts that you do while exploring the world. This mode is a LOT harder than the base game. And the optional goals for each contract are astronomically harder. I died maybe 10 times in the entire base game. I ve died at least 12 times on every single Death Wish I ve completed (except two of the early ones). Even with the Peace and Tranquility option which lowers the difficulty of a contract for a small amount of Pons these are brutally hard. So that is something to consider if you re interested in this DLC. , October 9 2018, I enjoyed this DLC! For $5 it provides a lot of content,chase,a

For The Glory: A Europa Universalis Game, Having played EU2 to death I eventually got around to trying this  enhancedversion of the game. Sadly I found it to be troublesome in terms of frequent crashes usually when scrolling across the map whilst also encountering various bugs that ruined my campaigns. For example one glaring bug with diplomacy made it impossible for me to cancel alliances with countries even if I was the leader of that alliance. With the option to cancel an alliance greyed out hovering over the option told me I wasn t in an alliance with Hessen yet to the left in the diplomacy screen it said I was. Further to this alliances are only supposed to last for a defined time period usually ten years before they expire. Yet for some reason the game automatically kept renewing the alliance so that in fact it never expired. It s a shame really because there s so much potential to  For The Glorybut it s annoying bugs and issues like this that break the desire to play it for any length of time. Especially after putting tens of hours into a Grand Campaign only for such bugs to appear. , July 20 2018, Having played EU2 to death I eventually got around to trying this  enhancedversion of the game,greer,a

Subject 13, What a disappointment. Given the credentials and the very Soma premise I expected the typical adventure tropes of unravelling a mistery reading old diaries while you examine the world and try to fit the pieces but instead of that ok you get the diaries but the exploration is minimal and the puzzles are the worst kind of mechanical puzzles. It looks like something that was thought to me used with touch controls which makes it awful to control with the mouse. And the puzzles? Doing 7th Guest kind of stuff to advance the plot? Only worked back then because of the novelty factor. And there are too many sliders and I already disliked sliders.

Homeworld: Deserts Of Kharak - Soundtrack, This is a decent soundtrack and a very long one (over 3 hours!). When listened to during the game it really creates an immersive atmosphere of the desert and can t be complained about. However it seems less memorable than soundtracks for Homeworld and Homeworld 2 and as a standalone album listened outside of the game isn t as good as those of earlier games.

Lone Survivor: The Director S Cut, (I have this game through Steam not GOG if that makes any difference) This game is just Silent Hill 2 mixed with Twin Peaks. I don t mean that in the sense that the tone feels like a mix between the two I mean that it s almost exactly Silent Hill 2 s storyline but with scenes from Twin Peaks thrown in. It s even got it s own Red Room with a little dancing man but the room is blue instead. An OK story can still be saved by good gameplay but I felt like the gameplay was a bit of a slog. Sneaking doesn t feel tense on a 2D plane and fighting enemies feels like a chore. Most enemies are your height so you just point yourself in one of two directions and slowly fire straight ahead. As long as you don t fight too many monsters at once you ll be fine. The game isn t really bad it s just not very interesting or memorable. I d recommend playing Silent Hill 2 or watching Twin Peaks instead of playing this rehash. , September 8 2017, (I have this game through Steam not GOG if that makes any difference) This game is just Silent Hill 2 mixed with Twin Peaks,mccullough,a

Guacamelee! Gold Edition, Fantastic game. This is how a platformer should be. As I started up the game I was a little worried with it recommending a controller to me. Turns out the keyboard controls are just fine! And you can remap them. The art style is great. The characters are memorable and have personalities. The hit-detection is spot on and you can get a real feeling of mastery when you get good at landing flashy combos and taking out all kinds of enemies.

Journey To The Center Of The Earth, Creative story sketch many horrible design choices. Environments are fairly creative and nice graphics. Somebody had a good idea for a story which could be an interesting adventure with some political undertones. Unhappily such ideas are not fleshed out at all. What we are left with is a skeleton of a story where characters tell you stuff or ask you to do tasks for no reason. Some elements of the story feel like a Syberia copy (minor spoiler: in Syberia a cell phone served as a excellent contrast between the mundane world and increasingly fantastic scenes the main character was going through -- here E-mails from the surface feel random superficial and annoying). But even with shortcomings the story is par for the course (of adventure games). The main problem is the awful gameplay! Some objects are un-pickable until some obscure programming flag allows otherwise; some actions can only be done if the character puts gloves on -- for no discernible reason and with no feedback about this. Some places feel unfinished (many machines could be very interesting puzzles but alas are just scenery). In many places pathfinding was horrible with the character getting stuck. And later I found out that some puzzles are cut from this version (which according to the walkthroughs I have seen was a good thing since it seems they made no sense).

Ruin Of The Reckless," Full video review here: https://youtu.be/J52eSdnlIx4 https://vid.me/BxGe Ruin of the Reckless is a rogue-lite dungeon crawler where your nameless character must traverse levels of a mysterious foreboding tower. As you ascend the dark tower spirits of ever increasing difficulty number and strength will try to oppose you from reaching the next level. The nature of the game lends itself well to any twin stick controller but I found the keyboard controls more than adequate as I fought my way past 15 floors of intense brawling fights of which there are plenty more. Character customisation is the key to gameplay here. You ll find anything from a elegant sword to stab your foes to a giant green hulk fist you smash down upon your enemies. Using various upgrades and trinkets your character can be enhanced with greater stats as well as the option to use ""ability orbs"" to further customise your characters skillset my particular favourite was to summon an army of pets to do my bidding. To add even further challenge or even ease to the game you can add cards to your character slots to change the flow and tide of battle. Resolution options are quite limited here ranging from 1080p down to 720p with full support for both fullscreen and windowed mode. Screen shake can be fully turned off which I found to be preferable over the default setting. Keyboard bindings are fully rebindable as well as some of the options for the controller of which the XBOX 360 PS3 and PS4 controllers are supported. There s also local co-op play available of which I haven t yet had the chance to test but a lack of online co-op is notable. Ruin of the Reckless is easy to play but difficult to master. Fans of other games in the genre should find something to like here as the game strikes a good balance between difficulty and progression ", May 5 2017, Full video review here: https://youtu,pitts,a

Army Men: Toys In Space," Army Men has always been a favorite series of mine despite only playing one game - Army Men 2. That game and its concept hooked me so well I was willing to play any game in the series. But as a kid I never found another game to play. In fact I don t remember how the hell I got ahold of Army Men 2 in the first place. So as an adult I had to catch up. But having played Army Men 2 it s hard being happy with what is essentially a DLC package for it. In fact having a mishmash of missions with no connection to each other whatsoever Toys in Space seems more like a series of fan-made levels rather than the real deal. Which is a shame since the premise to this game is very interesting. It seems aliens land on our Earth and it s up to us to fight them. The game does continue the old boring tan army vs. green army conflict - no-one deems it wise to band together to fight a common foe but adding aliens to the mix livens it up. The possibilities are endless but without much of a plot you don t get very much invested. I don t remember if Army Men 2 was very much different but my adult mind can no longer enjoy running and gunning aimlessly. Plus it doesn t help that the difficulty curve resembles a sine function. In your first mission you ll be given as much ammo and long-distance attacks as possible while at the next you ll be faced by respawning enemies land mines air attacks and incredibly accurate infantry men. And a mission or two later you ll be free to roam the map uninterrupted. You do get a few infantry men to aid you in your missions but they re as useful as tying a brick to your leg. Oftentimes I d ditch them and go out on my own. I survived longer that way. It doesn t help that their path selection seems to be ""take the scenic route and split up whenever possible"". This game is simply a grind - an affair of saving every few meters of progress. And as an adult I no longer enjoy such a game.

Swat 3: Tactical Game Of The Year Edition, First and foremost you should know I was only able to get this title working with a mod and some third party software. The native GOG release of this game did not work for me and I consulted support before stumbling onto a solution. In SWAT 3 you will be taking on the role of a SWAT team element leader operating in the city of Los Angeles and as far as I can tell it???s set around the time the game was launched so 2001. The meat of the game is in its campaign of which there are two the original base game campaign and the GOTY extended campaign. Throughout the main campaign you will be equipping and leading your 5 man team into various scenarios such as: hostage rescue anti-terrorist operations and bomb defusal. Unfortunately the customization options are a little lacking and you are only really given a handful of primary weapons to choose from. There are different ammo types that you can bring along but I found myself often forgetting that this was an options. It???s somewhat hard to really notice a difference in the weapons as recoil is not simulated and there are no first person models of your weapons. The campaign is rather fun and challenging. Thankfully though there are three difficulty levels you can choose from and you can even adjust the trigger speed of suspects on friendly ai officers. The ai while it sometimes stumbles is very good in fact I???d be willing to say it???s better than a lot of ai in modern games. Your ai teammates will be saving you far more often than getting you killed. My only real complaint is that some of the maps are really bad and the gameplay can feel lackluster and repetitive at times. All in all I???d say I rather enjoyed my time with SWAT 3. There are still those technical issues I mentioned that probably need to be ironed out but as a complete package I???m not dissapointed I gave this title a shot. , August 5 2018, First and foremost you should know I was only able to get this title working with a mod and some third party software,merrill417,a

To be fair the game is a pleasant one but it is far too simple. Not enough units factions terrain types game rules - not enough anything TBQH! I cannot believe this is a 2002 release.....

Realms Of Chaos, .... is shite. It s plain and simple and the first thing I wanted to get off my chest. The music is absolutely unbearably shite. The first thing that comes to mind looking at the screenshots and realizing it s a sword and sorcery game are definitely not some generic tunes that sound like they belong in a childrens jump  n run game. At it s best the music sounds like a bad version of the bowsers castle theme in the original Mario bros. games. That said the rest of the game is pretty great. Realms of Chaos is a fairly straightforward action platformer set in a fantasy world every 80s and 90s child could dream of. You fight awesome enemies like catpeople (Putting out fire with gasoline) with maces and swords wolves lizards skeletons golems and and of course annoying bats with your sword and magic which you can upgrade by collecting enough loot. The levels are like I said pretty straight forward so seldom is there any backtracking that needs to be done. But that doesn t mean that it s a walk in the park. The game can be pretty unforgiving at times especially in the later levels and in the bossfights which you have to try over and over again until you eventually find its weakness or learn the pattern. But defeating a boss after dying 20+ times and closing the game in frustration feels pretty rewarding. So if you want an action game that screams cheesy 80s fantasy you are willing to fail a few times and you turn the godawful music off and listen to your own powermetal playlist this game is worth every second and every failed attempt. , February 25 2018, ,schultz,a

Some of the deductions are not logical you have to guess the right one (some choices are equaly credible in my opinion but only one gets accepted).

Avernum 2: Crystal Souls, Avernum: Escape From The Pit was a solid surprisingly deep no-frills RPG emphasising turn-based combat questing and satisfying exploration. Avernum 2 is more of the same and if it s not quite as good as its predecessor it s only because its predecessor was close to perfect. As with the whole franchise Avernum 2 is a very focused RPG that chooses to settle for graphics and sound that are serviceable at best in order to spend its energy on a deeply satisfying talk-explore-kill-loot gameplay loop and a story just good enough to be interesting. For gamers who are remotely interested in a game with those trade-offs there s a whole lot to love here. I found Avernum 2 more frustrating than its predecessor. It has an unfortunate love of rewarding your discovery of new areas by locking you into them for extended periods and only allowing you to return to familiar lands after certain quests are completed. The stuff that is new feels frustrating and the stuff that is old feels a little stale. It s still a great game and its only real sin is being another dose of something you may already be full of. , November 1 2018, Avernum: Escape From The Pit was a solid surprisingly deep no-frills RPG emphasising turn-based combat questing and satisfying exploration,goodman3710,a

Caves Of Qud, I caught wind of Caves of Qud while watching GDC lectures on youtube and was enamored with the idea of a game that not only procedurally generated it s world and moment to moment encounters but also the lore of the gameworld itself. The number of strange character possibilities and wild adventures possible in Caves of Qud are staggering and unlike the games it seeks to emulate or some of those who stand alongside it it isn t needlessly obtuse taking the opportunity to blend together just enough old school sensibility with just enough modern convenience to lead you into a fun and complex - but not overly so - first hour or so of play as you figure out the general mechanics and systems that go into it. It s a solid ROLE playing game as well. The control you have over your character s abilities is amazing and fun and whether you have a favorite build stored in your library or like to play with the challenge builds offered during creation you ll always find a way to make a fun and interesting character even if their design means they aren t long for the world. Add to that the charming tile graphics and incredibly atmospheric music and you ve got a great night in of gaming (play it with the lights off and delve into a cavern! It s suitably spooky!)

Galactic Civilizations III: Crusade Expansion Pack," The changes made in this expansion are phenomenal. They took almost every frustrating thing about the game and made it better. I cringed a little bit at the introduction of ""Only one player can build this"" improvements but they re a lot more balanced than the ones in the Civilization series. So I m hooked again to the game. The reason I m being harsh in my rating is the extremely high amount of bugs. This is effectively a beta release. The UI is non-responsive in many instances (moving ships ending a turn etc). There are also quirks with portraits missing in the selection screen. But the worst things are the ones that affect game play. At one point I made a trade for resources. I lost my resources. I did NOT get the resources I was supposed to. Not OK. Seems to happen if I re-negotiate when the AI asks to trade. I didn t buy mercenaries so that may be related to the fact that United Earth is simply broken. The ships don t show up in the map. That means I can t play as United Earth because I can t build ships. It also means that if United Earth is set up as the AI the AI won t do anything. UE is essentially a minor race.

Dex, I recommend the game as I enjoyed it very much. Here are my thoughts: + very good exploration + great atmosphere + great style + stealth recommended + bonus suits are fun + cyberpunk + RPG elements are done well + took me 17 hours to complete and another 2-3 to hunt achievements (this is the only game I have 100% achievements on gog.com) Neutral observations: o combat heavy I lowered dificulty just to make it smoother experience (implants/suits can fix that) o bonus suits are seriously overpowered o I did not like the hacking at first but then I learned how to do it and it was ok/entertaining. However there are few things I did not like: - on of the first tasks is to find a doctor - but he is hidden! I ve spent 5 hours doing other quests unable to find him before I finally gave up and looked his location online - that is a serious design flaw!!! - made by small team so animations are mostly clunky could use more animation frames - music is very repetitive sounds like 1 minute loops in most locations Overall great game in my opinion :) , October 27 2018, I recommend the game as I enjoyed it very much,mcclure,a

Shadowgrounds Survivor, Shadowgrounds 2 is basically Alien Breed only with better graphics. So it does nothing new but what it does I find enjoyable having rarely come across such games. The story is pretty forgettable but adds an extra layer to the game - a military base is attacked by a horde of aliens and you seem to be the only person capable enough to do something about it. It doesn t make much sense but it adds to the experience. There s also enough attention to detail to make walking around that base a tad creepy and the music is just good enough to add to the entire experience. It isn t scary but it s the closest you ll get to it considering you have a top-down view and can see things coming from a distance. But as fun as this game is levels are short enough &amp; enemy behavior is predictable enough for the game to become stale after a while. Just kill horde after horde of enemies &amp; move on. There aren t that many types of enemies (many of them are unoriginal) so after a few levels you get to see them all. And there aren t that many weapons you can use. You are given more characters to play the more you advance which are interesting but by the time they re introduced you already invested so much time on the main character that they feel more like an unwanted distraction. And by the end of the game you realize there s no purpose to them being there. You can level them up &amp; level up their weapons but not in a unique way so it feels more like a pointless distraction than a bonus. The game also feels rushed - levels are short &amp; sparse of interactable items there s only one boss battle and the plot you re trying to advance gets resolved suddenly &amp; unexpectedly. Playing the three characters you re trying to get them to meet one another but when that happens it s more of a surprise than a feeling of accomplishment. The odd graphical glitch or slowdown doesn t help either as well as the ugly character animations &amp; bad unresponsive AI. Also Normal is almost too easy. , August 8 2018, Shadowgrounds 2 is basically Alien Breed only with better graphics,goodwin,a
>Observer_," As action scenes are beyond the player??s control on purpose I??d call this game a well made interactive movie. Detective work mainly focuses on reading memos and investigating crime scenes. The Devs might have taken the terminal operation part a bit farther like in MU Complex but it??s ok for my taste. The walking speed is intentionally slow as finding evidence hints or easter eggs is the main focus. The story unfolds around the well known topic of human augmentation and relating ethical questions as well as immersively well done details of the corresponding ""what if""s. If you like to pause inside a game to think further or to lose yourself inside a story this game is for you! The basic controls and limited range of dialogue options are perfect for a VR game so I??d love to try this one out on VR. Koyaanisqatsi in cyberpunk flavor. I loved this game for the 15 hours of gameplay it lasted as it comes close to the atmosphere I experienced in the original Blade Runner movie.

Convoy, This game is nothing like ftl at all. The both have quests. That s about where the similarities end. I won t go through comparing every feature of ftl because this isn t a comparison but rather an honest review of convoy on its own merits. It s a much different game and can stand on it s own. In convoy your ship crashes on an unknown planet. You then run around in an MCV with some escort vehicles looking for four crucial parts to fix your ship and leave. The planet has four warring factions. The game is a rogue like rpg the map is procedurally generated each time. There s an overworld jrpg style where you drive around and randomly encounter enemies on your way to do quests. Quests have some dialogue with some choices of responses that lead to different things. Sometimes it s combat other times you talk your way out of stuff it s also random sometimes. While one option like having a drink at a bar might turn out fine during one play through if you encounter this next time you may end up poisoned. There are also shops scattered throughout. You burn fuel driving around so you have to refuel and repair combat damage at these shops in addition to finding new weapons and stuff. Combat is really cool it s real time with you moving your escort vehicles around a grid to get in range of enemies. Some weapons use line of sight so you can block dmg to your MCV. Some weapons have special uses too. Enemies are somewhat varied depending on the faction. It s not super strategic though really just focus fire the right guys. All this is really well done but the downside is lack of content. You can beat a playthrough in about 90 minutes less if you skip side quests and by the time you are on your third you will notice a lot of quests repeating. There aren t many vehicles or weapons to get either. If someone made a content mod or there was a new version I would gladly give this four stars but I only got about 5 hours of enjoyment out of this title before hanging it up. , February 7 2018, This game is nothing like ftl at all,wilkinson,a

Alien Rampage, I had never heard of Alien Rampage before but I bought it because 1.) I like platformers and 2D action and 2.) I like to support games that didn t get the commercial success they derserve and support GOG to bring them to a new audience. After playing it I can say that Alien Rampage is really an excellent game much fun and very unique. Huge variety of level design very different enemies unique atmosphere on this alien world it s gory (nice contrast to other games of this genre and much fun) different cool weapons etc. It never gets boring because the levels and enemies are so different from each other so I was thrilled to play through it. Alien Rampage was released in Dec. 1996 in the 3D era when 2D was completely overshadowed by the 3D (except maybe a few long established franchises). If Alien Rampage would have been released a few years earlier it would have been quite successful no doubt. It didn t get the credit it deserved and was much underrated but fortunately 2D is popular again and GOG brought this hidden gem back. I have only praise for it and can only recommend it to everyone who likes platformer action sci-fi or just appreciates a very unique game. , August 4 2017, I had never heard of Alien Rampage before but I bought it because 1,curry,a

Valdis Story: Abyssal City, I feel like most of the negative reviews were by people who only relied on gog/steam recommendations and didn t really know what they re getting into when buying the game. So I thought I d give my 2 cents. Valdis Story: Abyssal City is not a game where you button-mash your way to the end or a game where you can switch your brain off. It s closer to Devil May Cry and Darksiders 2 - there s a style meter and combos but also crafting a skill tree and magic. A lot of info is provided as dialogue or item descriptions and after stage 1 you find a training dummy you can beat up to your heart s content and learn combo attacks. In the beginning you need to take some time to learn the ropes. Because dare to do something stupid or not pay attention and you will get punished! So it s not a walk-in-the-park-game. However if you re willing to learn you ll be able quickly to do some pretty cool moves like combo locking enemies etc. Sound music art and animations are well made. Be sure to watch some gameplay to make sure they suit your taste before buying tho. There s not much to the story. There is a lot of lore however which you can unlock from side quests. Unlockable lore is different depending on the character you play as. Each of the 4 characters has different strengths builds and play style and slight changes in dialogue. There is a fair amount of backtracking but rewards are worth it and either make your character stronger or let you explore different play styles. Controls are tight. I did runs with a keyboard a noname gamepad and a xbox 360 controller. Had no issues so I m baffled that so many people complain about the controls. Tho I guess every setup is different. All in all it s a unique mix of genres and one of the few platformers with good combat and dynamic action - a polished high quality gem. And ultimately fun! Also a lot of player feedback has made it to the patches after release so shout out to the devs for that. , July 12 2018, I feel like most of the negative reviews were by people who only relied on gog/steam recommendations and didn t really know what they re getting into when buying the game,watkins,a

Blake Stone: Planet Strike, Like many of you guys I played the original Blake Stone as a kid. It was probably the most advanced FPS my PC could handle at the time (Tandy 386 with 1 mb RAM running at 25 mhz). However it hasn t aged that well mainly for the level design. The difficulty curve is very steep and there is a lot of backtracking and getting lost in the mazes which are arguably all too big. This is a problem through all 6 missions which are really monotonous. I never got a chance to play Planet Strike back in the day but now that I have it I can say that it s *way* more fun and way more contemporary than the original. It looks better thanks to a tweaked engine (complete with lighting effects that have me squinting into the distance). The environments are more interactive and the weapon designs are improved -- thanks to Cygnus studios the folks who made the great-looking Raptor. But the key difference is the level design. The levels are paced well where load-up zones come between monster-closet shootouts and there s much more linearity than before. The live map makes things much easier to navigate (sort of like Corridor 7) and works much more smoothly than the later versions of Aliens of Gold. The levels are smaller than AOG but I don t think that s a problem as it makes it much easier to play a couple of levels on a coffee break. The secrets are also much more telegraphed and intricate than before and more rewarding too. The Blake series s biggest shortcoming is lame bosses but at least they are a little less predictably placed in this game. It s never going to be Doom or Doom 2 but it s a lot of fun. , January 25 2018, Like many of you guys I played the original Blake Stone as a kid,walton3949,a

Hogs Of War, I loved the PS1 version of this game. The music the voice acting the video clips and pretty much everything was about as perfect as the genre has gotten. I can get over all the little bits which are awkward or not quite up to scratch on the PC version but the lack of AI movement kills the game. Instead of moving around the map and interacting with the environment to best attack your pigs they remain in position only rotating to aim. This starts of as dumbing down the game play hardness but soon moves to making the game extremely difficult (not in a good way) to unplayable. Some of the maps have the starting positions for the AI as hard or impossible to reach for the player but a good and varied starting position for the AI. By remaining static classes which should rely on melee range fire aimlessly. The player has the same issue when using those classes against that position. Maps which should be about racing the AI to equipment and vehicles become extremely one sided. I bought the game with the intention of completing the campaign a few times and playing multiplayer with family like I did with the PS1 version years ago but I could only get to about half a dozen level in until the AI issue became too much. Avoid if you liked the original PS1 release as it will just tarnish the good memories. , August 14 2018, I loved the PS1 version of this game,morrow7282,a

The Void, Dieses Spiel bietet im Vergleich zu all den anderen Spielen mit 08/15-Gameplay eine spannende Abwechslung. Die Story ist ergreifen wenn auch zum Teil gruselig gestaltet. Das Gameplay wirft einen von einer Herausforderung vor die N??chste und stellt wirklich etwas Neues in dem Sinne dar.

Stars In Shadow, Bei Master of Orion 2 oder anderen Spielen in diesem Genre werden mit zunehmendem Forschungsfortschritt immer mehr planetare Einrichtungen freigeschaltet dies f??hrt dazu das in solchen Spielen es schon fast zur Qual wird wenn man im sp??ten Spiel Planeten neu besiedelt. Hier bei Stars in Shadow gibt es nur wenige Geb??ude die aber durch die Technologien verbessert werden. H??rt sich doch gut an. Leider wird dieser Micromanagement reduzierende Faktor dadurch zerst??rt dass die Planeten durch verschiedene Technologien weitere Baupl??tze f??r Einrichtungen erhalten. Hat ein gro??er Planet also am Anfang nur 6 Baupl??tze f??r Fabriken usw... so sind dies sp??ter bis zu 10 oder gar mehr. Man muss also doch wieder die ganze Zeit alle Planeten kontrollieren. Dazu kommt das die GUI im Verlauf eines Spiels immer langsamer zu reagieren beginnt. In einem Spiel mit 95 Systemen ( bis zu 4 Planeten pro System ) wurde es f??r mich ab der H??lfte des Spiels frustrierend nach jedem Mausklick immer ~ 05 Sekunden zu warten bis die Bedienoberfl??che des Spiels auf den Mausbefehl reagierte. An den K??mpfen st??rte mich dass ich die Formation der Raumschiffe vor dem Kampf nicht ??ndern konnte. Oft ist es besser die Schiffe eng zusammen zu positionieren um mit Abwehrwaffen mehrerer Schiffe einen Raketenschwarm zu bek??mpfen. Die Schiffe werden aber mit L??cken zueinander platziert. Die Diplomatie: Erkl??rte den Krieg eroberte viele Systeme hatte keine Lust mehr auf Krieg schaute ob ich genug Diplomatiepunkte habe vereinbarte Frieden mit den Aliens. Irgendwie langweilig. Wenn eine KI eine andere angreift und man ein Flotte im System hat kann man in den Kampf eingreifen. Wenn zwei KIs eine angreifen nicht. V??lker sind vorgeschrieben man kann sich kein eigenes Volk generieren. Fr??he Expansion ist die beste Strategie KI expandiert langsamer.

A Boy And His Blob," The wonderful graphics and smooth animations make this a beautiful game to play. The pace is rather slow more focused on solving puzzles than hard-packed action. For most of the puzzles you can take your time and figure out what you need to do without worrying about enemies attacking. Most levels in all four world follow the same mechanic: guide the boy and his blob through a level while having Blob collect 3 treasure chests. You have to use the different shapes Blob can take objects from your surroundings and the boy himself to solve the increasingly challenging puzzles. At the end of each world you ll have to fight a Boss but these are relatively easy to play once you find out the weakness of each boss. When you finish a level with all three chests found you can play an bonus ""challenge"" level. The challenge being that you usually can use only one or two Blob-shapes. That makes the puzzles in these levels less intricate these levels are more about skill and timing. All in al a fun game for a few hours of not-too-difficult gaming.

Memoria, As with it s predecessor The Chains of Satinav the first thing that will strike you about Memoria is the gorgeously rendered art. The illustrated style is beautiful and every bit as suited to the narrative as it is to the concept of traditional fantasy. The animations are smoother and more realistic than in Chains of Satinav and the transitions are more realistic. The orchestral soundtrack is wonderful its not overpowering and does not detract attention from the gameplay or environmental sounds. The voice-acting is particularly pleasant and the actors they have chosen are very good (in English I m not sure of other language localizations) carrying across their characters emotions in a sincere and convincing way. In other titles Daedalic have hinted at their capacity to tell stories well and here in Memoria they have reached a pinnacle. Each character is distinctly realized and stay true to their motivations. The narrative itself is both an interesting interpretation of the quest story whilst also introducing the Dark Eye setting. Less lore is revealed in this game than its predecessor but what is revealed is done in small sections that are quick and easy to assimilate letting the story continue without getting distracred bo too many details. In addition the intertwining narratives are skillfully executed both Geron s and Sadja s quests mesh well together and the juxtaposition and movement between the two is executed well without becoming dull or uninteresting. The gameplay is amazingly logical. There are a few moments where you will be surprised at the combination of items but on the whole the interaction between objects+world is surprisingly easy and consistent. Where the game does throw a curveball though is in the environmental puzzles as these may become quite tricky to resolve especially if you haven t paid attention to the clues from dialogue and scattered about the environment. This is most definitely a game that encourages observation. , September 4 2018, As with it s predecessor The Chains of Satinav the first thing that will strike you about Memoria is the gorgeously rendered art,atkinson1593,a

The Solus Project," A sequel to ""The Ball"". This one is a survival game with an actual story a path to follow and lots of hidden secrets. Difficulty can be changed between 0-400%. As such it can be a grueling challenge to survive or a cakewalk. There s a helmet of sorts around the edges of the screen mostly just annoying. Saving isn t frequent though you can sleep at any time as long as conditions are good to save. The way text on tablets you find slowly appears is annoying. I get what they were going for with a machine translating it however this doesn t make it any better dealing with this when every second gets you closer to dying. Like they couldn t decide whether it truly was an exploration or a survival game. Is the story worth it? No it s pretty simple and not that interesting. It obscures details early on to keep you interested; this would work if not for the fact the game is 12+ hours long. If every location was shorter/smaller the game would ve been better off.

Botanicula, otanicula is a wonderous game. Not only is it an elegiac fable against the forces of entropy (or just plain olgood vs evil/life vs death) but it s quirky and cute and utterly gorgeous to experience. The art work is beautifully rendered with a soft glow to it that makes the game feel almost dreamlike. The seeds you control as well as the myriad strange creatures you encounter all have distinct and unique personalities that burst through their designs. The audio is truly delightful with sharp changes in sound as you enter new areas and not to mention the amusing noises you will hear upon interacting in various ways. The gameplay itself is fluid and smooth the game works very well as a point n click adventure and the animations integrate seamlessly with the movement of the mouse. The puzzles themselves are not particularly difficult but do show some measure of increasing difficulty and near the end require you to recall a fair amount of information from the interconnected areas in order to succesfully solve them. They do also allow for multiple puzzles to be worked upon at once which gives the player some freedom to solve them in the order they choose rather than be stuck on one and stop playing in frustration.

With your companion the Death Knight if he or you die then it is game over! Why have a companion if their death will kill you as well? The game is also very buggy. I made it to the final battle only for the game to crash and to corrupt my save file. Thank goodness I made multiple saves or I would have been screwed. The story is also less interesting with the only highlight being the ending twist. I can not recommend this game. , October 4 2018, The sequel of Divine Divinity,pickett5300,a
Celtic Kings: Rage Of War, Had a hard copy of this game back in the day the second I got GOG this was the first game I looked up. Love it. Played through the campaign three or four times. It isnm t like most RTS games out there with unique game play that involves pre-built buildings so no need to spend the first twenty minutes of gameplay creating your village. The Campaign foscuses on a hero protagonist who can level up and gain special items which is great. Youy could speed thropugh the campaign in five hours if you wanted to or you could spend time exploring the maps and solving hidden side quests. Fantastic game that concentrates on lore and strategy versus formulaic empire building. , October 2 2018, Had a hard copy of this game back in the day the second I got GOG this was the first game I looked up,caldwell,a
Sunless Sea, Wot I liked - The world of fallen London. Haven t heard of it - grew fond of it; - Various dialogue trees/options. Seem to have a significant impact on the game; - Nice artstyle; - Exquisite language of the narration - I cannot express it strong enough - I ve always been a sucker for elaborate writing and walls of text but Sunless Sea is just a lot of fun to read as a book. I was really embarrassed/excited that I had to google some words to get the full understanding; - Many different monster types with cool descriptions and interactions; - Nice atmosphere. You d think that looking at a top-down boat knifing the darkness in front of her with a lantern is not enticing - you d better think again; - Wonderful music! Wot I disliked - Simplistic boat itemization - there are like 5-10 similar weapons (of 3 types) and some auxiliary items - nothing gamechancing... - Kinda repetetive. Sailing in the zee is okayish but 99% of the fights are resolved by backtracking/sticking to the back of the enemy ship; - Some game mechanics: e.g. your ship s hold is TOO DAMN SMALL. I have a dreadnought (the biggest ship in the game AFAIK) and I have to backtrack all over the map because I don t have a bale of some cloth or a sack of coffee or a bottle of wine for some wino! To sum it all up - I feel that this is a great game following in the footsteps of Space Raqngers. You should definitely check out both games cause SS is the spiritual successor or SR. ...Or just go and buy the soundtrack. , November 5 2018, Wot I liked - The world of fallen London,vang,a

Unreal Gold, Leaving the spaceship and walking on the alien planet -- with the open sky the strange animals and atmospheric music -- still gives me chills to this day. Sure the story-telling is very linear the 3D environments aren t up to modern standards (though they haven t aged as badly as other games) and there is a fair amount of scripting... but this is a classic. The use of lighting enemies that react to your attacks (rather than just running at you) and huge open spaces - these were what set it apart in its day. Ignore the expansion pack - Return to Na Pali - since this is just the rejected levels from the original development with some terrible voice acting. , October 30 2018, Leaving the spaceship and walking on the alien planet -- with the open sky the strange animals and atmospheric music -- still gives me chills to this day,snider,a
60 Seconds!, The 60 seconds to grab supplies is fun. I thought you would get to do this periodically to grab more supplies and save your family but unfortunately that s not the case. The rest of the game is a slow slog watching family members go starve dehydrate go crazy and die. There s no way to have enough resources to keep everyone alive no matter what you grab in the first minute. This is played for laughs. There s an emotional problem here. The rush to grab supplies builds sympathy for the dad and family. Why would we then enjoy watching them suffer? Conversely if we want them to suffer why would we rush to grab resources? NOT FUN. , May 25 2018, The 60 seconds to grab supplies is fun,cunningham,a

Massive Assault: Phantom Renaissance," This is the most singleplayer-oriented of the Massive Assault titles with a whopping five modes of SP in addition to the tutorials. Also the two sides in this one have unique units. The basic game is a ""world war"" that takes place on a continent divided into several countries of 20-40 hexes each. A third of the countries are neutral a third are held by the Free Nations Union and a third are held by the Phantom League. However only one of your held countries is visible to the enemy at the start of the game all the rest of them are ""secret allies"" that appear to be neutral. A country can only produce (finite) resources if there are no enemies on any of its hexes so the ideal strategy is usually a line of cheap units backed up by heavy artillery. The game s signature ""move"" is flanking one of these formations by revealing a secret ally on an unguarded border and producing a strikeforce to pour in next round and cut off their supplies. Of course what if that secret ally you just used was itself bordered by a secret ally of the enemy? The tactical combat itself is entirely dice-free. Units do a certain amount of damage at a certain range and have a certain amount of hit points. A 1-HP enemy is just as damaging as a full-health one. Terrain brings no defensive bonuses only movement penalties and impassible barriers. You can t move through a hex containing the wreckage of a destroyed unit until 1 round after it dies so cheapo units will hold the line while you wait for reinforcements to come from overseas. The music is a series of crazily bombastic military marches along the lines of the Total Annihilation games. I like the graphics but the textures especially for the terrain are very muddy. The voice acting in the campaign is beyond bad and enters the realm of David Lynch surreal. Ahh... but I did mention bugs. Keep the autosave on because this game is prone to crash-to-desktop especially on the orbital station thunder map. Recommended!

The Real Texas, Moving while shooting unequips your gun. The shoot button also moves you so you spend quite a lot of time running in circles when you re trying to shoot while being killed by stun-locking enemies who latch on to you then jump off at your feet making them difficult to aim at. It was just infuriating. I couldn t take more than a few hours. A quest log would have helped. I get that the game is about exploration but it would be nice to have had it.

B-17 Flying Fortress: The Mighty 8th," I want so badly to love this game and yet the games makes this so hard. B-17 Flying Fortress: The Mighty 8th sets out to create a historical flight simulation of unprecedented accuracy. Leaving no stone unturned the team recreated every switch and every detail of the B-17 down to the fuel mixture for the individual engines. The graphics have aged remarkably well and the crew management adds a challenging and intriguing dimension that makes it feel like a cross between a flight simulator and a naval simulator. At the time of its release rumor had it that B-17 was facing delays that forced the team to cut a planned multiplayer feature and this time pressure is evident in the final product. Play the game for a few hours and you start to notice that the parts of the game not concerning historical accuracy feel very glossed over. Time acceleration feels thrown in at the last minute. Most radio traffic is not logged to the radio book (why?) and if you are flying at 8X time acceleration the radio text will be on-screen for - you guessed it - 1/8 of the time. This includes critical messages like ""I am bleeding to death"" from your pilot. Its such a simple thing to fix but its clear there was no time for it. Speaking of on return from a recent bombing mission I was using the navigator as we approached the English coast. Suddenly with no flak or fighters in any direction for over an hour two crew members announced that they were severely wounded. No explanation. Five minutes later a bomber from my formation fell out of the sky - no smoke from the engines no radio traffic. I get it - realism dictates that sometimes bombers have mechanical problems. Realism also dictates that the crew should alert their formation to this fact! Good luck configuring your joystick you ll need it. This a game that should have been delayed a few months to get the polish it deserved. Recommended only for the die-hard WWII simulation geeks.

Nantucket," I now regret I did not try this game on Steam I would refund it immediately. While the game s premise is interesting enough - whaling traveling on high seas sounds okay. However the game is extremely thin content-wise everything is very lazily done. There are two most important questions I ask about every game - how entertaining is the activity you spend doing most of the time and how difficult and interesting are the decisions you have to make in the game. This game fails in both - the main gameplay loop is the embodiment of dullness. You just sail somewhere and watch the numbers slowly change. Water decreases. Grog decreases. Food decreases. Sometimes winds blow faster so youh travel a bit faster and vice versa. Sometimes a meaningless event occurs - hey Captain this crew member does not drink too much - you can either ""gamble"" - 80% chance you inherit his ""positive"" trait 20% you inherit the opposite trait. or you stay away and nothing happens. Inconsequential and dull! The crew members are rows in a database table anyway. They are represented by the same picture (all hunters are the same for example) they have a few stats and positive and negative traits and that s it. You cannot talk to them. You cannot get to know them. They could be robots it would not matter. The game boasts that you can ""travel around the world"" but all the cities are represented with the same picture. How lame is that? Sometimes you get a ""quest"" - discover a new whaling territory. So you slowly trudge there you fight a single fish you sail back and that s it - you get a few dollars. Or you are going after a ""pirate s treasure"" - you make a few choices like ""go alone"" or ""go with the crew"" you have no information that would help you decide and in the end the game you find an empty chest or some coins but it s equally uninspired and boring. The game design is really extremely uninspired - there is some underlying system of resource and crew management but it s all so thin and uninteresting you will be hard pressed to find reasons to keep playing. This game represent the worst of traps the indie scene offers you can fall into. Avoid it like scurvy and plague.

Dungeon Souls, It took me a cool minute to get the handle on what the real style of the game was as I didn t read any lore or pay attention to any help/tutorial stuff. So because of that when the Redeemer came and kept killing me I got super frustrated because I couldn t seem to kill it. After realizing that you can t the real style of the game sort of clicked with me and then it became crazy addictive. Every level is intense because you re racing to against the clock to optimize between discovery items and experience. The character depth is pretty cool and not being too far into the game yet I haven t really tapped into the forging much but having found some recipes it s a very neat mechanic. Coupling that with the Ranks that each character gains--also there are unlockable characters which is a nice addition--makes them a little stronger over time which helps. On a random side note I have the Logitech G910 keyboard and the colors change according to various triggers in the game! Each character classes changes it on selection and it goes dark when you re really low health for added difficulty and suspense. There are several other cases where it changes but I ll leave those for you to discover :) Very cool feature. , May 9 2018, It took me a cool minute to get the handle on what the real style of the game was as I didn t read any lore or pay attention to any help/tutorial stuff,gilliam6887,a
Giants: Citizen Kabuto, I remember this one very well. I can remember playing the trial version I think and then it was released as a one title in the series of extremely cheap but original games in Poland with full localisation. It cost like 2999zl which is like 85$ at the current exchange rate. The game was so fun I loved parts with Mekks the best but the other parts are awesome too. As for it s time of release the game had very nice graphics and nice cartoony character style. Every character in the game has its own personality the story is entertaining. Considering all of that I do need to mention Polish localisation of the game. We had full audio and text translated and I dare to say I loved all the gags the best in my native language. I dare to say it was one of the best translated games ever into Polish. It had all then funny moments that original had had the references and the word-plays that original game had in English. It was this kind of translation that you knew that the voice actors and text writers acutally knew what they are talking/writing about. At this moment it s sadly not available in Polish so I ll stick to my old CD s that I have somewhere at my parents house. But once it s available I ll buy it for the full price with a smile on my face. , June 5 2018, I remember this one very well,buck,a

Litil Divil," Keep in mind this is a 1993 title and a product of its time. In 1993 these ""Hugo"" dial-in telephone games were THE thing on breakfast TV with people directing little horned creatures through a maze via their telephone keys which were notoriously slow to react. Litil Divil parodies that on many levels. Instead of a fancy intro you will find the background story on the first pages of the manual. Animations are a bit sketchy and cut-scenes are basically not there. And as far as controls go: they were more or less meant to play like the ""real thing"" meaning they are minimalist and a bit unresponsive. Because that s exactly how it was and just what people wanted back then to - you know - ""train"". The game itself thus closely mimics the TV labyrinth games including the infamous doors as well as the ridiculous spiders and spikes that become visible very late are difficult to anticipate and drain a third of your health. Each door in the maze leads to a mini-game. All these games are different: some require your jump&amp;run skills some are a parody of classic beat em ups. Others require you to memorize sequences or solve puzzles. Certain rooms need to be solved in the right order as some of them will give you items. The game can only be saved by finding and entering a specific room on each level which contains a little bed and allows you to manage your save files. Here is the thing: if you are a child of the 90ies you will probably get the puns find the humor hilarious and perhaps even remember the TV shows and games that are parodied. In that case the controls and difficulty level only add to the flair of the game. But if the 90ies were not your time there is a chance you will loath this game from the bottom of your heart. After all these telephone games WERE unfair and difficult to control - that s the whole point. ", March 2 2018, Keep in mind this is a 1993 title and a product of its time,zamora,a
Surviving Mars, I love this game. The marriage of Paradox Interactive and Haemont studios is a match made in heaven. Let s start with the theme. Mars is a great setting for a city-builder but Surviving Mars takes it a step further with its retro-utopian art style and mood. The gameplay strikes a good balance (imho) between automating the tedious stuff and giving the player interesting decisions to make. The game also revolves around disasters. In most city builders disasters are a way of adding to the challenge and breaking up the monotony of business as usual. That s not how disasters are conceived of in Surviving Mars. Rather a lot of your colony planning revolves around the inevitability of disasters. Disasters are not things to react to as in most games but something to plan for. Currently there are four types of disasters (dust storms dust devils meteor showers and cold waves) and each of them threatens the viability of your colony in different ways. I ve seen some reviews which complain that the game is very punishing in that if one thing goes wrong your whole colony might fail. While this is true I don t see that as a bad part of the game. Mars is not a hospitable environment. You need to think ahead about the future needs of your colony as you expand and ensure that you don t run out of a critical resource. Don t start building a ton of wind turbines if you haven t set up a steady supply of machine parts. Don t bring heaps of colonists prior to establishng a large enough food supply. And always make sure that you have enough water - which is extremely scarce on Mars. Without it you can t work your farms or synthesize fuel or keep your colonists hydrated. Other notable features: Brilliant soundtrack. Cool techs with a unique take on tech progression. Lots of flexibility about how the game is played in terms of difficulty types of disasters special game rules. On-going development. The dev team is extremely responsive to feedback. , October 8 2018, I love this game,hayes2933,a
Tyranny - Tales From The Tiers, I really enjoyed the small additions from this DLC. The game looks more solid with them random encounters are not only battle - you can meet some villagers make some small decisions and get some prize e.g. status effects which are quite valuable for battles. You should be aware that this DLC introduces more text and all that events will start like text adventure. For me it s totally OK as it is not needed to recreate every small scene with a 3D objects just a description is enough. New game + feature is also cool I waited for that and it works good. If you playing Tyranny for the first time or you willing to try a different path - you should have this DLC. p.s. yes all these features should be in the game from the start - but better late then never , October 13 2017, I really enjoyed the small additions from this DLC,campos,a

Offworld Trading Company, This game is a rather interesting RTS. The base building and managing side is pretty enjoyable but it kind of feels it has a dichotomy on what type of strategy game it is. It appears like a managing/building game like settlers (and kind of plays like one) but the game is very competitive and ends very fast. Most games will probably be over in 30mins which is a stark contrast to most other managing/buidling games (like settlers). It s a well made game and because of it s niche gameplay it wont appeal to a lot of people. Also the single player offering is kind of lacking as it s mostly focused on multiplayer rather than single player. It is a really interesting game but I wish it would offer some single player modes that are more settlers like. , October 16 2018, This game is a rather interesting RTS,hicks9336,a

Mount & Blade: Warband - Viking Conquest Reforged Edition, Arguably one of the most appealing aspects of the Mount and Blade games for me at least is the level of customisation that comes from what you can tweak or what you can mod particularly in the sandbox game. Considering that Viking Conquest was basically based on and made by the same team that created the amazing Brytenwalda mod the lack of additional [sub] mods is quite surprising and limited mostly to tweaks. That said Viking Conquest is perhaps a little more polished in overall gameplay than Brytenwalda but I d venture that it also loses some of the charm and certainly the customisation options that made the latter such a great conversion mod. Having played both now I d honestly say that for the sandbox experience Brytenwalda wins my vote. The added bonus is that it s also available for free making Viking Conquest a rather expensive alternative which for the most part doesn t add or improve too much on top of the Brytenwalda concept. Viking Conquest practically seems to have been ignored completely by the modding community. There s hundreds of mods for Brytenwalda yet only a handful for Viking Conquest. The problem there is that the large majority of mods that work with vanilla Warband or Brytenwalda often don t work or apply well to Viking Conquest. In particular that means UI improvements and tweaks you might be familiar with just won t work in Viking Conquest. As for how well Viking Conquest works using maximum settings for things such as battle sizes I only encountered one CTD in over 100 hours of play which suggests that bugs or issues other reviews have complained about have most likely been patched and fixed in the current version on offer. Overall considering you can get pretty much the same flavour of gameplay with Brytenwalda I d honestly say Viking Conquest isn t worth the full price on GOG but perhaps worth taking a punt when it s on sale like I did. , November 5 2018, Arguably one of the most appealing aspects of the Mount and Blade games for me at least is the level of customisation that comes from what you can tweak or what you can mod particularly in the sandbox game,malone6181,a

X-Com: Apocalypse, This is one of my favourite games as I ve kept coming back to it over the last 20 years since I first played it in high school. Personally I greatly enjoy the pausable real-time tactical combat allowing me to stop the action and plan my next move when a previously hidden enemy is suddenly revealed or even teleport out of the way (once you ve discovered it). On the other hand you can also play in turn-based mode similar to the original XCOM if that s your style. The vehicle-based combat above the city adds a new element as well giving you the choice of cautious sniping or a full assault with explosive ordnance -- at the risk of wasting all your budget paying for repairs after you level a city block. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this style of game.

Desperados: Wanted Dead Or Alive," Among me and my friends Commandos: behind enemy lines was a great hit. We d always tried all sorts of tricks and traps to avoid getting seen while planning to pick off which enemies in what order. The game was hard but this didn t stop us. Rather the contrary. When I first saw Desperados in a store I think I bought it purely on a screenshot (""hey: this is commandos in the far west!""). It was...and still is. But as I played it became clear that this went beyond a mere theme change. The atmosphere of a spaghetti western was spot on in every aspect it had a storyline that was both great and fitting and the abilities allowed for the same sort of sneakiness. Better yet: the insane hardcore difficulty of commandos was tuned down as shooting guns could save you when you were discovered. These fire fights were much more rewarding even though the chance of surviving them was still small at best. It even had the ability to zoom in and out! Now...we are obviously talking 2001-2002 here. There s a fair chance I still have the disk in my basement somewhere but I really don t regret buying it on GoG. If for no other reason to get the much later released linux port (which doesn t have the issues that I see in other reviews). The only reason it gets only four stars is that to my own surprise the game is much harder than I remember. I had forgotten the act of saving just about every step (and certainly after every unalerted kill). I had forgotten that random things like putting down a music playing watch could alert 5 extra guards. Exiting a door and punching someone in the face fast enough can t be timed in advance (and misclicks mean being discovered). I have been spoiled by ""stealth games"" where guards can just see a cone directly in front of them. All in all: it s a pretty hard game. An absolute gem...but know what you re getting into.

Sword Of The Samurai, I was growing in influence when a rival without honour attempted to blackmail me. I rejected his threats but when I and my samurai army were attending to a request from my daimo my rival sneaked into my estate and kidnapped my child heir. I disguised myself as a ronin and sneaked into his estate to get my kid back but was caught and forced to pay a ransom for myself. Enraged I gathered my forces and attacked but my daimyo decared my attack unjust and my rival murdered my son in retaliation. Two moves later my rival begged permission to marry my daughter. Good times. I spent countless hours on this game as a kid and it s just as entertaining as ever--except that unfortunately the battles are just as slow and dull as ever. If it wasn t for the unbearable tedium of battles I d give this a full five stars. Melee on the other hand is great--picking a defensive spot to hang out with good maneuverability and picking off my opponents or sneaking through a houseintent on liberating a bride or committing dark deeds. It s amazing that this game stands up so well after nearly three decades. , July 8 2018, I was growing in influence when a rival without honour attempted to blackmail me,heath3440,a

The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky, Game looks good and was well made. For that I can applaud it. The story starts out a little slow but I could get past it. I really liked the magic system with the orbments. Also the battle system is pretty cool. I enjoyed all the features special attacks the animations. All five star. The writing was good but I did get offended once whether intentional or not. Some people will not share this sentiment. I feel there was a low blow to real world religion in the beginning when poking fun at  Sunday School .

Space Empires IV Deluxe, Space Empires IV is a historical and ambitious game that deserves its place in your 4x collection. As you play keep in mind it was made in 2000 and you will realize the ripple effect that it has had on the depth of today s empire builders. Don t expect a space-opera fantasy with sexy alien girls. SEIV is an empire builder designed to have you churn out massive batches of ships in supply chains stretching across the map using and expending the resources of star system after star system to push your enemies to annihilation. I ve heard stories of sprawling play-by-email games rivaled in length only by Diplomacy (yes the board game). If this is not your bag the game just isn t for you. The game has buildable ring worlds dyson spheres and planet destroyers huge machines that you actually need to deplete star systems to build. Careful resource management and good organization of designed are a must with expandable supply pools and limited filtering respectively. The galaxy creation in my opinion is a huge selling point-- It s powerful and concise and lets you control how worldgen shakes out to make every game different. Same with the tech tracks such as Psychic and Crystallurgy that you pick during racegen. Yes of course there were plenty of development tradeoffs. Malfador Machinations is just one man and art was never his strong suit. The race portraits look especially dated and ship designs just look like bricks or turds diplomacy is not really a factor AI is not amazing. The music stark and minimal was surprisingly good in my opinion but won t be a strong point for most. SEIV also helped inspire a production chain heavy play style that was a clear influence on MOOIII and disliked by many in that game. As someone who s played thousands of hours of 4x from MOOII through Stellaris with everything in between I can t overstate the influence of this independently produced game on both the genre as a whole and my personal views on what makes a good 4x. , October 16 2018, Space Empires IV is a historical and ambitious game that deserves its place in your 4x collection,rice,a
Kindred Spirits On The Roof, Being a visual novel it s hard to review this in detail without spoilers. I wanted to like this game. I thought the concept was interesting and after reading reviews elsewhere I decided to take the plunge. The characters struck a chord with me right away and for the first two-thirds of the game I was enjoying it. However the last act lowered my opinion of the game. I m not sure that one of the later relationships was seeded well enough and the ending seemed... a bit weird. I don t regret my time playing it - and I bought both the drama CDs and the manga so that I can spend more time with these characters - but I m not sure I can recommend it very strongly. , October 16 2018, Being a visual novel it s hard to review this in detail without spoilers,horn,a

Haimrik," This is a short (3-5 hour) game of puzzles revolving around what order to use various words to remove obstacles mixed with brief action sequences. Both are fairly simple the puzzles are obvious and direct but there s often a small twist that elicits a ""Why didn t that work/Why did I die?"" followed oh ""Oh missed that I get it now."" Mostly satisfying. The controls are a little wonky. Everything s centered around the left-hand so trying to move aim and shoot can be difficult. Fortunately the action sequences are forgiving enough it doesn t really matter. The only time it was every a problem was one sequence trying to shoot an overhead enemy in a specific weak point and hitting up+fire seemed to randomly fire as it should not fire at all or fire after a delay. I was a little put off my the tone initially. At first it s not clear if the games going for a gory absurdist surrealism a fantasy parody or a somewhat grim fantasy story. There s a certain amount of tonal clash and the first scenes don t come off that well but after the initial town it decides it wants to take itself seriously and more or less succeeds. The story is somewhat barebones and cliche but the focus characters get just enough development so you can like or dislike them as appropriate and care about the stakes.

Kholat," So I bought the game as my yearly Halloween Scare-Fest - lights out beer in hand. I was hoping for something akin to the EXCELLENT Miasmata - meaningful environmental exploration with a map compass and a few landmarks. Instead I found a game that annoyed me within the first 5 minutes. It s a bit pretty sure but other than that it s tough to find a more frustrating game. Maybe I never dug deep enough but it seems like the game is the epitome of aimless wandering. Sure you have a map some coordinates and a compass but who cares. The start is just run in some direction and hope something happens. I was tempted to not write a review but I feel like I had to add my 2 cents to what was already there - the user Roisack really hit the game on the head. Rarely do I quit on a game this soon but something about this one just irked me. Disappointing all around. Like being railroaded down hallways you don t exist then killed by a random monster. I often justify a game purchase like this as ""It s like buying a coffee."" Here I would have rather had the extra coffee. Go play Miasmata instead.

Basingstoke," There are currently no reviews so I write one. I dislike all things zombie but I love this game. I bought it for the stealth and diversion aspect and did not get disappointed. The atmosphere is great the soundtrack fits. It is dark deadly creatures lurking everywhere and you have no idea what is going on and how to survive this. Fitting this you discover crafting recipes as you find the ingredients. I really like that. You start as a secretary and can unlock other characters (for a new game) as you go and they have their pros and cons. I unlocked the police officer and the way that happend made perfect sense but I would like maybe a little hint as to how to unlock everyone of them. Because I only achieved that because I love exploring every inch and am bad at survival games so I died one or two dozen times in the same sector which gave me plenty of opportunity to achive that unlock. (SPOILER: Bashed a lot of creatures with a truncheon.) Yes I died a lot. The point is I died because I made a mistake and I knew it right at that moment. Usually it involved clinging to that food (even though I had plenty and there is no hunger need) instead of throwing it as a diversion to get to safety. I hoard too much worrying I might need that stuff more desperately in later levels. Every time you die everything is different: Building interiors where you find loot and what loot you find placement of creatures and machines and such. Items come in three categories. -1 your backpack -2 campsite stash -3 your ""pockets"" (ammunition: bullets shells nails darts) 2 and 3 seem to be unlimited but 1 is restricted. You start with 4 slots and I strongly recommend looting thoroughly to find the suitcase (seemingly) in every level because you can only use and craft/reload with the things in your backpack and ""pockets"". All new loot (no limit for carrying that) goes into your backback and is saved in your campsite stash once you reach the new campsite. I love this game.

Kenshi, Reviewed 5th September 2018 I really wanted to like this game and considering the release I played was 0.98.55b I was hoping that being so close to the 1.0 release development might be at a good stage by now. Unfortunately Kenshi is riddled with various frustrating bugs severe pathfinding problems and a wide variety of other issues that detract greatly from gameplay. Worst of all is the poor optimisation and lengthy loading moving between areas of the map frequent crashing or saves corrupting which leads to hours of gameplay lost. The UI is functional but also very unresponsive at times. The biggest problem for me with Kenshi is that it s like a melting pot of ideas some of which seem really good but also seemingly without any clear direction from the developers. There s certainly no lack of content and this gives the illusion of depth but that s what leads to the biggest disappointment. When you start exploring different elements of gameplay and key dynamics of the game they re all very shallow not fleshed out or simply broken. All in all a great shame. I spent countless hours delving through what Kenshi has to offer only to realise that in the end it s unlikely to get any better than it is now. I have read that the developer plans to continue adding content after the 1.0 release finally arrives which the game will certainly need if the best ideas are to be fully fleshed out. Personally I won t be holding my breath. , September 5 2018, Reviewed 5th September 2018 I really wanted to like this game and considering the release I played was 0,noel,a
Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight, As a metroidvania title I really enjoyed this game. It s atmospheric the controls feel nice and snappy. Combat is simple but satisfying. I don t really have any complaints just noticed some small ways the game could be better... -The game lacks ambient noise. Not a big deal but would contribute to the atmosphere. -Music sounds very midi-ish. It s understated and ambient but the low quality sound was constantly noticable the music itself is nice though. While the game is retro in a lot of ways i would have enjoyed sampled instruments and modern synths. -Lack of items/weapons/abilities. It just felt limited in that regard. -Limited abilities in general. You can only have a small number of passives and active items. Wish they could have found some other way of handling that. -Lack of lore text... I feel like the game could have gone all out with lore just finding random bits of text and items that delve a bit more into the world than is currently avaliable. Characters talk to you and wander around the map but it feels like more of this would have added a ton of intrigue. I really enjoyed the game and would recommend it to fans of the genre technically though it could be more robust. , October 26 2018, As a metroidvania title I really enjoyed this game,ballard,a

Steamworld Dig, You ve probably heard that this is a mix of Metroid and Dig Dug and while the Metroid elements are greatly overstated they do exist and there s a bit more to it than just that. You re digging your way down a shaft and as you do ground dug and enemies killed remain that way in the main shaft. On your journey to the bottom you ll be looking for materials which you sell on the surface for money which aside from being currency also acts as your experience; the more you bring in total the more the town develops and the more upgrades you can buy. It s a rewarding system that prioritizes making the right choices but at the end of the day you will be able to buy every upgrade with plenty to spare. You have a lantern that gradually consumes fuel as a sort of timer but if it runs out you just can t see as well so minerals will be harder to find; you re never left blind or killed from your lantern going out. The game s deceptively tricky; you have to be careful how you dig in order to make sure you can get back up to the surface easily. There s a minimap that points out landmarks such as caves and teleporters to help you as well and it will also point you in the direction of your next main objective. As for the rest the music story and graphics are all decent but nothing too outstanding. The theme is both Wild West and Steampunk which is an unusual mix and it works well enough. The different minerals that you find look neat and it s fun seeing which you ll dig up next. Perhaps more importantly the visuals do a good job of telling you what you re looking at so you re never just banging on random blocks hoping that something will happen. It s a pretty short adventure so if any of this sounds appealing it s certainly worth giving a try. , September 3 2018, You ve probably heard that this is a mix of Metroid and Dig Dug and while the Metroid elements are greatly overstated they do exist and there s a bit more to it than just that,flynn,a
Tahira: Echoes Of The Astral Empire," The game is basically a sequence of battles with some narrative in between. If that sounds a bit limited then that impression is about correct. Anyway strong points: turn-based combat is fairly decent setting and story intriguing graphics and sound downright great I like the style. At highest difficulty the game is also remarkably hard. Weak points: the game is unpleasantly streamlined even when compared (not exactly fair comparison but anyway) to Unfinished Business or Fallout Tactics which themselves felt restrictive compared to their predecessors JA2 and Fallout 1/2 respectively. This is further exacerbated by how saving/loading a game works which discourages from experimenting. Additionaly how units are/are not carried over/healed to/before next battle is rather opaque game mechanics. For example some battles consist of multiple sub-battles and units carry over from one sub-battle to the next with will (think ""mana"") and health/guard not replenished. The problem is you do not know this beforehand and may end up in the next sub-battle with hopelessly exhausted units and at the same time you can not reload (unless you save &amp; quit and then mess with files which is possible but tedious) the last or next-to-last turn of the previous sub-battle to pick up some resources and heal build up will or avoid at this point needless damage or losses; you have to start the previous sub-battle all over.

Graveyard Keeper, as of November 11 of 2018 the game is good. i bought it right before holloween and have atlease 20 hours so far and its been nothing but enjoyable. the story is compelling enough that i want to know what happens next. the quests for the most focus what you should be doing to progress but you can ignore all of it until you decide to get to them. and there is a ton of content and with all the different ways you can go about making money and improving your graveyard its yet to feel stale and i still have more than half the techs still to unlock. the pacing feels fine as soon as i get the hang of a mechanic or new work station im about ready to unlock something else. but its not all good. you will need wiki. the game is not great at explaining its nuances of what items do where that new work station you bought the tech for can actually be built things like that. and i have to agree with other reviews on the corpse system i have no idea what that text box was trying to tell me and i know mostly what to do with corpses. though what makes a corpse good to bury besides having no red skulls or whats the difference between 4 or 6 or 8 green skulls is ive no idea. in conclusion watch a beginners guide and use wiki if you find yourself scratching your head. after i watched a video i settled into it and its been great so far. , November 2 2018, as of November 11 of 2018 the game is good,small,a
7 Billion Humans, Nice puzzles good atmosphere but... New mechanics ruin it - where first game was quite witty about how to give puzzles with limited number of commands here you have it all You have shredders and copiers you can take boxes and check numbers on adjacent spaces you can set specific items to memory slots to order your employees to get there you can send messages and react to them... And yet all you get as a result - is clumsy heap of features which don t really work well together. Most of mechanics are introduced to be completelly dropped out in a couple of levels. This gets really annoying when you see an interesting solution to given puzzle using some of the commands from previous levels and simply can t implement it because in this level those commands are not available. Variety of commands also results in clumsy interface - you need to click through 2-3 menus/submenues to create the command you need. Multiple workers result in more complex debugging situations and debugger is not powerful enough here. Some of the new commands can yield quite counterintuitive results and generally work as a magic(e.g. reassignment of memory in case box was destroyed) All in all where Human Resource Machine was neat clear compact and whole.

X-Com: Terror From The Deep, Great game as everyone else says a re-skinned X-COM UFO but underwater. 5 stars one of my favorites. Quick fun fact though. For those who have ever played the original release of the floppy disk version there were many missions where you would find a crashed airplane underwater. Usually something resembling an MD-80 or something of that size. However because of a significant number of serious air disasters (three unique US planes crashing with all 100+ people aboard dying) they removed any underwater mission that had these planes underwater unrelated to the mission. If you got the updated version of the game or the version on CD it would have had this stripped. If I m not mistaken simply updating the game removes these potential mission levels as well.

Highway Blossoms, I thought I would like this visual novel. I spent some time in an RV with my grandpa in Arizona and while he wasn t a hippie he was closer than anyone else in my family until me. Unfortunately AlienWorks messed up pretty much everything although as usual with RenPy games it seems to technically work as intended. The outline of the story seems to be a fairly stereotypical romantic comedy; a chance encounter an overly dramatic situation near the end and various obnoxious aspects of the story that I guess were intended to be amusing. There are additional aspects of the ending that I didn t like although I can t think of a way to describe them without spoilers. In general I didn t like the story or any of the characters. Almost nothing about the story is believable and not in a way that you could suspend disbelief about a few things and then enjoy the rest of the story. The voice acting is generally good but also has a few issues. The music is another very disappointing aspect. The story fundamentally involves music but the music supplied is completely generic and they don t even put that to as good of use as they could (the music doesn t really flow with the story most of the time). Most games suffer from this same problem but most don t rub your face in it reminding you over and over how much better the story could be if it had some good music to go with it. The visual aspect is also fairly minimal. In several cases there are black screens when it would have been nice to show something and they didn t have all that many scene changes. None of the images are all that memorable. Overall I regret buying this visual novel and will avoid AlienWorks and Sekai Project in the future. , October 23 2018, I thought I would like this visual novel,booker6670,a

Heroes Of Hammerwatch, I really like Heroes of Hammerwatch for what it is: a fine rogue-lite ARPG - no matter the grind-fact. The team has included many good ideas into the game. But what really destroys the experience for me are the bad controls compared to the first game. You have to use both control sticks to just move - one for walking in a specific direction and the second to look in a specific direction. If you just want to walk the view doesn t face the walking direction. Furthermore if attacking it is a auto-trigger attack (constantly attacking). I prefer to attack once for each button pushing. Autotrigger should be optional imo. Not a satisfying game experience and a lack of immersion due to the bad controls. , June 17 2018, I really like Heroes of Hammerwatch for what it is: a fine rogue-lite ARPG - no matter the grind-fact,battle,a
Runner3, There s a fine balance to be struck when creating a sequel. Change things around too much and it will feel like the game lost its identity; keep it too much the same and it goes stale. Runner 3 achieves that balance quite well. Gone are some features I loved but the new additions make up for it with a few exceptions. For example I loved having to unlock new outfits by finding alternate routes in-game now I have to buy them; but I still have to find those alternate routes to get the collectibles so I can unlock new characters and even (a stroke of genius if you ask me) the story cutscenes. The game features only 3 worlds with few stages each but those are much more varied and interesting this time and full of alternative routes. The songs are more memorable and distinct than they were in Runner 2 although they still don t hold a candle to the ones in the first game. Gameplay-wise I like how it gets much more difficult much faster than last time. I always felt Runner 2 took too long to start getting challenging so it s a welcome change that they are taking inspiration from the first game s difficulty curve this time. The game is shorter than 2 yes but it will still take a long time to master it. And while there isn t a traditional option to change difficulty you can choose which of two paths you ll take before you start a level one being much more challenging than the other so there is the difficulty selection right there. This is a sequel after all; if you need practice go play the previous game - you won t be sorry you did. If I have some criticism it s for those occasions when the game strays away from its rythm based roots. The retro game is fun but I would prefer it to be rythm-based. Still not enough to knock a star off though. In conclusion I love the Runner series for its addictive challenging gameplay but also for its evolution from game to game. All of them are equally fantastic and Runner 3 is a great addition to the franchise. , May 28 2018, There s a fine balance to be struck when creating a sequel,wells,a
Layers Of Fear: Inheritance, This is a bit different from the base game. The environments were generally more colorful which I thought added a nice touch to the surreal nature of it all. The jump scares weren t as prevalent but that works to its benefit. Most Horror gives way to something as it reaches its resolution. Maybe you find a rocket launcher and start blasting through hordes of the undead and punching volcanoes as it gives way to action. Maybe you start running toward the daylight into providence as it gives way to hope. My favorite works of Horror however give way to emotion. Now I didn t think that this was as good as Theresia: Dear Emile or the movie Mama but this is a tale well-told. The last game s story was told from the perspective and shattered memories of a raving lunatic suffering from alcoholism. This on the other hand has a fresher more neutral perspective of the daughter caught between her two parents. No matter which ending you get the story is a sad one and beautifully written at that. Though its tone is different from the base game this comes highly recommended if you enjoyed it. , February 22 2018, This is a bit different from the base game,mcbride4465,a
Ys VIII: Lacrimosa Of Dana, Maybe because i played this game after the mayor patchs is that i managed to play it without mayor problems. Port was ok to me. The game run smoothly and it was very enjoyable. This is a Y s game with all the letters. great story great characters and the same action packed RPG. Was in normal a little too easy but the game has many dificulties to choose from. I love the settings the upgraded graphics to a more actual style were nice too one can actually see from a distance all the locations from others locations (kind of Dark souls was) when the story progress so adol reached the highest mountain in the game you have a nice view of the whole island that was a wonderful detail. I loved Dana story and how affect the whole party. I got just a few complains the game maybe lacks of higher level dungeons and also lacks replay attractive I just hope that Falcom keep growing to make more wonderful games as this was. If you like the ARPG or played any other Y s you will love this. , July 8 2018, Maybe because i played this game after the mayor patchs is that i managed to play it without mayor problems,gardner3683,a

Broken Sword: Director S Cut, Este juego me da un buen viaje en el tiempo cuando me encontraba una tarde alla en el 2000 jugando con mi PSX a Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars. Tenia tiempo separados de los juegos Point-and-Click y por medio de GOG he adquirido esta version Director s Cut que a mi parecer se ha realizado estupendamente algunos bugs de escena se han resuelto por lo que veo. (+) La interfaz fue mejorada un acceso mas vistoso al inventario a las opciones y las notas de los protagonistas los dialogos nuevas graficas imagenes y dise??os. (+) Luego de unas horas dedicadas para completar la trama la idea de poder tomar el control de Nicole fue bien planteada solo que es por un periodo muy corto y deja esa sensacion de querer saber aun mas porque si se toma en cuenta un 80% de la historia veremos luego a la misma sentada en la sala de su apartamento. (-) Por otra parte hay dos actores que doblan en el idioma espa??ol a George algo incomodo muy bien pudieran haber borrado al anterior y colocar al nuevo mas sus nuevos dialogos. (-) Algunas escenas en el idioma espa??ol se cortan abruptamente. (-) Hay algunas escenas como por ejemplo en Siria luego de la secuencia del gato sobre la mesa este no aparece visualmente mas pero aun puedes interactuar con el. Asi como tambien en otras escenas de conversaciones que vuelven a aparecer como si nunca hubiese pasado. Esta version la recomiendo ademas que es un juego clasico y que todo amante de Point-and-Click debe tener o para aquellos que quieran experimentar con un buena ejemplo dentro del genero. , July 31 2018, Este juego me da un buen viaje en el tiempo cuando me encontraba una tarde alla en el 2000 jugando con mi PSX a Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars,tanner,a
The Age Of Decadence, First this game is HARD so if you like games where people are taking you by the hand avoid it at all costs ^_^ That sentence alone will help you understand why there are some negative reviews. My review on the contrary will be highly positive ! Why ? Because that s a game where you need to think every actions that s a game where you need to optimize your Build to optimize your path to optimize everything in order to stay alive ! Every skills you ll use will bring you even more skill points so you need to optimize your experience investment in order to get the most experience out of your skills. Let s say you have 4 doors and 4 chests behind these doors in an area invest enough in the lock-picking skill with all these locked doors and chests you ll win enough to reimburse your investment. Trust me that s a good way to think in this game and so it will imply a lof of quick / load save to test the best ways to invest your experience. The Battles are tough some are even VERY DIFFICULT ! But trust me once again... Once you understand the mechanics you ll prevail in every battles ! And when it s possible just avoid some battles to come back to them later. By the end of the game you ll be able to wreak havoc and even kill the 3 strongest foes of the game (not naming them to avoid spoilers). I ve spoke about this game in my TOP 6 RPG you never heard of on my website because this RPG is worth all the advertising it can get ! It s really a little jewel and i highly recommend the Spin-Off Dungeon Rats in Murderous Psychopath of course ! I also created a little guide on this Spin-Off !

Rise Of Industry, I understand this game is EA but it is still too poorly made even for EA; The game lacks a lot of content and the content there is is not properly introduced or explained so you got no idea what the heck you are doing. And to top it off- the game performs terribly this game barely runs at 10 fps on my laptop (which has a i7u). With that said if the game explains itself better improves performance and... makes everything better im sure it will be quite fun.

Va-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action, In the marriage of gameplay and narrative if one s lacklustre the other can keep you going. This is an ideal game to play for 30-60 minutes at a time for some relaxation. The characters are well realised but unless you get personally invested there s not much to keep you engaged. It s a relaxing experience rather than anything engaging and could have benefited by being half the length. By the 3 hour mark the mechanics had lost their charm and I had to force myself to play because I wanted to know how it ended.

Into The Stars," ...in a different reality. Where do I start with this one... well first of all you should click on the ""Begin"" button in order to quit the game. It s a signal the game gives from the start. Other reviews here are true - the game process is monotonous and repetitive. But what is the worst is the amount of random - it is way too much. You can pick just 6 crew mates from the start and then you send three of them to the surface of the planet order them to explore a site and one of them gets suddenly gets killed. And you don t seem to have a way to resurrect or replace the guy. This all means you have way less control over what happens to your ship or your crew than you d like to. There is no strategy pretty much or even things like tactics. The almighty random beats it all. And the story is kinda boring. I d really like to love the game but I can t. And it s a pity as it looks like this game was loved by its developers. ", July 24 2018, ,prince,a

Caveat Emptor I guess it depends what you are into as a gamer whether you prefer short arcade style games or epic adventures.

Renowned Explorers: International Society, You ll have a lot of fun with this the first couple of times through the adventure. It s fun that you can choose different ways to handle the encounters and how you handle the encounter affects what you get out of it. But whatever route you choose the encounters play out in the same turn based combat (you have to use your imagination to know that sometimes this combat is representative of a conversation) and there is a lot of it and although it is unique combat among games it is highly repetitive with in this game. And so even though this is designed as a rogue-like you won t feel the need to replay it once you ve finished it once or twice and that can be accomplished in a couple of sittings. Maybe every indie game doesn t have to be a roguelike? , September 25 2018, You ll have a lot of fun with this the first couple of times through the adventure,ford199,a
Neverwinter Nights: Darkness Over Daggerford," Why pay $9.99 when the original module is available for free as a download? I struggled a bit with this question before clicking the buy button. After playing for about two hours I can confidently say that I am really glad that I decided to buy this DLC. I ve played the original and right off the bat it is clear that there are improvements. About 75% of the dialogue is voiced now which adds considerably to the immersion. It is also clear that additional dialogue has been added. The companions feel more fleshed out. There are cosmetic improvements as well such as new portraits and making the most of the new tech improvements that Beamdog have implemented. The sky is beautiful and the colors really pop! Darkness at Daggerford is my favorite of all current DLC expansions including  Hordesand ""Shadows"" from the base edition. Modeled after  Baldurs Gateclocking in at 25 hours this is a really solid adventure that offers the best of what NWN module creation is capable of (including an overland travel map). It s classic D&amp;D in a computer game at its finest without feeling like a massive time commitment. I love the smaller scale of the adventure - it feels like a mini tabletop campaign played over a few weeks. I am very happy to support the developers too because of what happened with Atari screwing them over right before it was completed. Its time that they are paid for their work and to pave the way for future DLC creation for NWN! ", October 14 2018, Why pay $9,miles,a
Minit, Minit est un jeu rapide et minimaliste. Vous parcourez le monde et pour accomplir un objectif en 60 secondes.

Shadow Man, Shadow Man es un juego que a fines de lso 90 era uno de esas grandes joyas que deb??as jugar si gustabas juegos de aventuras y de un reto en sus puzzles mas que considerable.

Tiene efectos sonoros mas definidos y uno que otro extra en los mapas. La cantidad de enemigos me pareci?? mayor.

Como CONS sigue adoleciendo de las mismas pifias de las versiones originales se te queda pegado en los bordes de algunas estructuras cosa que te permite usar glitches cl??sicos as?? como morir por no poder escapar.

Antihero, The campaign is entirely a tutorial for the multiplayer component. The game itself is really enjoyable with quite a few interesting options. I find this genre of games really interesting: if you want a challenging strategy game you have to play against other humans -- AIs are just too dumb. So your options are to play an RTS where the advantage will go to the player who can click and use keyboard shortcuts fastest; or to play a game like Antihero where the turn-based nature of the game means you actually have to focus on strategy. 4Xs like Civ are just too long to play against other players and their balance isn t great either. As a member of the  challenging strategysub-genre (as I call it) Antihero is great. You can play asynchronous games where you play a turn whenever you get a chance. The game mechanics are fairly unique and there s very little use of randomness making it easy to reason about future moves.

Richard & Alice," This is a short adventure game that can be completed in one sitting. The art isn t bad and the atmosphere is believable. What is troublesome however is that the game lifts many of its motifs from McCarthy s ""The Road"" including the annoying little kid only the conversations in this game are more infantile. The puzzles are very simple but some require a lot of backtracking and the game forces you to re-examine hotspots because they yield new items as the plot progresses. The story is certainly intriguing although the twist at the end could have been executed better. Still the developers show much promise (I liked how they handled the subtle triggers that affect multiple endings) they could probably do a very good game with a better budget and a bit of feedback.

This really made the playthrough enjoyable as it brings up a lot of funny situations and ethical/philosophical questions about the choices you make in the game.

Doom 3: Bfg Edition," I was a major ""doomhead"" back in the day. The first level of Doom 3 was everything I d hoped for and more. Spooky - downright creepy. They stuck with the ""things from Hell"" story line. I was concerned they d do something with a zombie-like virus. Controls were good. Graphics were excellent for the time (they re now somewhat dated). With that said the remainder of Doom 3 relied on jump scares and minimal if any lighting. There s actually old jokes about how insanely visually dark Doom 3 is. I would best describe it as turning off your monitor and wildly fiddling with your mouse. Your character had a flashlight but lacked the expertise to hold it and a pistol at the same time. I suspect the new Doom Guy couldn t walk and chew bubble gum. Anyway this was eventually addressed. The lighting increased somewhat. Mod-packs introduced a flashlight/pistol dual wield and an armor-mounted flashlight. The part of the fan base that liked the darkness rebelled and began to hate on the game. The players that didn t like the darkness were already turned off (myself included) and also hated on the game. Thus all the bad reviews. The game play really isn t bad. The big room wide fights from Doom 1 and 2 are gone. Sweeping levels in a tactical manner is the norm. If that s for you then this game is for you. If you want to relive your Doom 2 plasma bullet hell room full of bad guys fire the BFG and pray memories this will disappoint. ", October 7 2018," I was a major ""doomhead"" back in the day",bates,a
Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, The story is OK by far not as great as everybody says it is. The controls are so awful and almost cringeworthy that it kind of breaks the game. The game has no penalty for dying thus all the fights become a chore instead of thrilling. There is absolutely NO thrill to be had in the fights.

Crookz - The Big Heist, I m only about halfway through the game but so far Crookz is fun despite the random crashes every couple of hours. Fortunately the game autosaves every time you do something so the crashes are only minor annoyances; though the achievement for completing a heist (if you launched the game through GOG Galaxy) won t unlock if a crash occurs. Hopefully they will unlock when replaying a level after unlocking all the thievesskills and I ll update my review if I confirm if this is the case. The first few heists are easy but not boringly so as you re still learning each thief s skills what each tool does and security system does and how the guards react. The one and two star levels only require patience and can be played almost entirely in real-time but once you hit 3-star difficulty the game starts to become a real challenge requiring genuine strategy split-second timing with multiple thieves on the move to do different tasks at the same time which you ll need to carefully plan out in pause-mode. Though there are many ways to complete each heist from the 3-star difficulty and up you will have to think carefully about which thieves to choose and what tools to bring giving the game good replay value. Overall Crookz is a good stealth strategy game. Yes the guards return to their patrol routes after hearing a noise of seeing something out of place as is typical of this kind of game but the developers have taken that into consideration and made that part of the challenge. (Maybe Skilltree/Kalypso will incorporate a heightened search mode with a countdown until the police arrive if they make a sequel.) One last note: Apparently there is a crookz.exe ransomware which Malwarebytes (and maybe other antivirus software) will confuse with the Crookz.exe game file so be aware that you will have to make an exclusion if you don t want to keep reinstalling the game. , October 7 2018, I m only about halfway through the game but so far Crookz is fun despite the random crashes every couple of hours,dorsey,a
Democracy 3: Extremism, $4.99 for something that adds little to the game especially considering there are several modders on the Positech official forum alone that are willing to give away even more. For five dollars I was at least expecting an increase in the number of features not just something someone with no knowledge in coding could do by himself. Add new political groups (coders anarchists or LGBT populations would be nice) new interfaces (election campaigns would be a great addition) or even new countries (I d really want to see what it d be like to play as something outside the most powerful countries in the west.) TL;DR - It s not enough doesn t add much to the game and is by no means worth five dollars. , September 28 2014,$4 ,carlson,a

Infinium Strike Demo," Since TD games aren t really my thing I m only going to review this demo based on what kind of content it offers and how well it does its job as a demo. I figure that people who want to know if they will like the full game will either look at the reviews for the full game or download this demo right away. This review is here to let you know if downloading the demo is worth your time or not. So the demo for Infinium Strike basically offers you two tutorial levels to try out: one that explains the basic game mechanics while giving you instructions to follow for the whole level and the other one introducing you to the various weapons and abilities you can use as well as several (all?) types of enemies and what they do. I didn t find those tutorial levels to be very well thought out. The first one is a very barebones introduction to the most basic game mechanics (most of them you won t even need if you re used to TD games) then proceeds to just telling you which weapon to use and against which enemy but fails to explain you why. The ""advanced"" tutorial does the opposite. It throws at you a comprehensive list of all the weapons ship abilities and enemies (which by the way are quite difficult to tell apart from each other on screen) but doesn t explain how to collect ressources how to effectively use weapons and such other basic things. All in all each tutorial is lacking some crucial information you will only find in the other one. I felt like it would have been much better with only one big longer tutorial introducing all the mechanics at once. I m still giving this demo a slightly above average rating because despite having only two flawed tutorials to offer you should know by the end of it if you will like the full game or not. And that s what a demo is made for.

Stasis, I read the positive reviews of this game and expected something great. Unfortunately while is looks good and plays fairly well the puzzles and logic are at times incredibly frustrating; the vast amount of text you read through looking for clues/guidance only to find out nothing don t add to the wonky storyline. All that said the best thing about this game is the numerous ways to die. , November 4 2018, I read the positive reviews of this game and expected something great,moran6711,a
Inquisitor, The story line is very interesting and the game has a wonderful dark theme to it. You are indeed an inquisitor using everything from charity and persuasion to intimidation and torture to root out heretics. The feel of it is relatively untainted by modernity as the heretics really are a threat to the townspeople as they ally themselves with demons and witches and the like. The difficult and sometimes tedious gameplay is worth it for that. But that brings me to the tedious gameplay. I don t mind the difficulty. That at first you have to kill simple bats for a while to build of XP - that s fine. I like that you can t take on big monsters at first and often have to flee until you are stronger. But the dungeons are needlessly tedious! There s so much cheap loot that you have to make trip after trip to unload it. You might want to leave it behind but you find you actually need the money (unless you save scum at gambling). With the deeper dungeons you get further down then have to make that long trip back up where monsters keep spawning even though you killed them all and buy more and more potions to survive just a little further. As you go back down monsters have respawned yet again and you keep going through more and more healing potions to get just a little further and then make that long trip back up again! To the writers I love what you re trying to do here but take a tip from Diablo. 3 words - town portal scrolls. It would make the game so much more playable. I m all for a challenging game. I m not for a game that s difficult simply because you have to have the patience to go back and fourth and back and fourth getting more and more potions selling more and more cheap loot to buy the potions etc. It s a shame. It really spoils and otherwise awesome game! Love the torture by the way! Love it! , September 25 2018, The story line is very interesting and the game has a wonderful dark theme to it,castro1378,a

The gameplay is generally fun and requires you to plan ahead because your troops aren""t super mobile (which is good). Unfortunately luck is way too important in the game. Particuarly in disruption/fragment/break checks Graphics are nice and basic. Music is lacking. Tutorial is useless but manual is good. Campaigns are enjoyable but a bit bare: just a couple of random battles strung together with some text reinforcement choices and your units gaining levels. Although it has a lot of army lists the difference between armies and units isn t that big with the base game. Get the feeling that this is so to shift DLC.

Epistory - Typing Chronicles, When was the last time you played an RPG typing game? Never that s when. Typing games get a bad rap because they feel implicitly educational but typing words out in order to attack isn t much different from pressing one key or clicking my mouse. It has its own natural difficulty slider (giving you more challenging words to type quickly) and there s something amusing and weirdly satisfying about fighting monsters with the power of language. The elemental powers you get to enhance your attacks are perfectly balanced and all useful in different ways. I really liked the world I explored too; and the art style is striking clever and beautiful. I wish it had surprised me more with the rest of its gameplay though and if it had I d also wish it was longer. It just relies on its gimmick a bit too much. As it stands it s about 6 hours long and that feels right for what the game offers. The puzzle segments are very uninspired and the story is a bit cliche. I had a lot of fun with it though and it makes me hope we ll somehow get more games like it. , July 25 2018, When was the last time you played an RPG typing game? Never that s when,larsen,a
La-Mulana," This game is a masterpiece. For people easily impressed by loud noises and shiny objects the game looks great and has a fantastic soundtrack. What we all care about in a videogame though is the actual gameplay the interaction. The game has a very well done platforming aspect and combat that aren t just ""good enough"" but fine tuned and fair to make it incredibly rewarding to master and a game that can stand on its own on just those merits as a 2D platformer. Momentum based jumping is used so plan your actions out. But where the real value lies is in the puzzles. The platforming aspects are great but this truly feels like it is supposed to be played as a puzzle game. It puts you right into a ruin like Indiana Jones and gives you full reign to discover it and find your way deeper. The puzzles are everywhere be prepared to have a full chapter added to your game notebook at your desk because you will want to write clues down often as they come up so you can read them all back later and put them together. The rewarding sense of accomplishment from mastering the puzzles of La Mulana is its biggest strength. Along the way you will make use of your trusty adventurers laptop that you can find different software for throughout the game which is a very novel idea that I ve never seen in a game before. The boss fights are difficult exercises in platforming and combat and each one is a treat to savor and remember after they are gone but you will always know that you earned it once you defeat them. If you have low amounts of patience want awesome buttons or are the type of person that uses guides to play games don t bother playing this because the charm and quality is lost on you you are not the target audience. Frankly trying to force the game to conform to your lack of spacial memory lack of critical thinking and lack of ability to do anything without quest markers only degrades the quality of La Mulana and other good games that are rarer and rarer these days.

Wizardry 8," I played this last year it had been a free gift from a magazine some years prior. It had been sitting in the ""to be played some time in the future"" pile of games. It had been ditting there for years because I was put off not so much from the dated graphics but from the minor sci-fi elements. I decided to give it a second chance after the rave reviews I d been reading all over the internet old and new. I was on my Xmas holidays and I said to myself ""I ll give it 1-2 days of playing if I m not hooked by then it s uninstall time"" The thing that initially kept me playing was the frequent level-ups on the early stage of the game (they get less frequent as you gain more levels and rightfully so). With six characters on the team (they later become eight) you has a level up every 45min or so. After that I d become accustomed to the gameplay mechanics my eyes got used to the graphics and it was sheer joy to play for days on end! Never did I get bored or lost any enthusiasm until the end.

I ve played a few games and reached the final Cryptark ship but imagine it will take more attempts to beat it.

Infested Planet," Great game. The pacing is good. There are pseudo-random levels to choose from even as part of the main campaign. You get money to unlock new techs at the ""map"" area (Which if you want them all you have to repeat some levels for money. But again the pacing even of this is good.) but you still have to use in-mission resources to use it. The ""double dip"" sounds bad but it works really well. Stages are rather fun some frantic bug slaughters some slow captures and a few hair-pulling defend-against-a-raid ones too. UI is decent with acceptable (remappable) keybindings.

Remothered: Tormented Fathers," This is probably one of the best horror games available on GOG right now. It does have some flaws: the game was a dream of Italian Chris Darril and it was developed in Italian so the English script and voice acting while not BAD clearly show it wasn t the primary language the game was written and voiced in. There s a late part in the game that feels hastily done and it gets aggravating especially because of the difficulty spike it presents players with. Some people found the plot convoluted and confusing and couldn t make it very far because they thought the first antagonist to be ridiculous and not scary. These are all legitimate points and if you are one of the people who thinks one or more of these issues to be a deal-breaker all I can say is that I understand why and you re absolutely entitled to your opinion. With that out of the way here is why I love this game: Darril had been meaning to do a spiritual sequel to Clock Tower since late 2007 and this is the culmination of that dream. He grew up watching the great Italian giallo and horror classics so he wanted his game to be ""giallo Clock Tower with logical puzzles"". As far as I m concerned he succeeded. While 2016 s NightCry failed to meet expectations for a ""modern Clock Tower"" Remothered nailed it. With the added bonus of a great giallo scrip cinematic presentation superb sound design excellent atmosphere surreal plot that evolves into a nice ""Profondo Rosso""-twist close to the end. There are some jump scares but they re extremely well done never felt cheap to me. Some answers are left unanswered but this is just part one out of three. Also if you watched any classic Italian horror films you re used to not having everything explained to you by the end of the movie. The game looks and plays great and you can get around 8 hours of play time out of it. For part of a trilogy that s pretty good. If you like Clock Tower if you enjoy giallo cinema then grab this game. It s superb. ", July 9 2018, This is probably one of the best horror games available on GOG right now,thomas,a

There are some quests that can be ruined by experimenting but if you read all the clues carefully you ll get them. It took me a weekend in easy mode but you could probably complete it in a day if you wanted to. The only reason why I am not giving it five starts is because there is no in-game way to keep track of quests.

Freespace 2, Played this game when I was a kid. Played it in school played it two years ago played it now. Never gets old. The Vanilla game is fine if you want 1080p and some other goodies like speech commands (albeit basic ones) get the Open-Source re-implementation from Hard light. The game is better played on a controller. You simply can t pull up with a mouse for so long. The game is immersively challenging. You don t have access to anything that your avatar wouldn t have access to. Each mission you need to beat in one go no saves scumming. You can get in trouble for things that other (non-Deus ex) games wouldn t notice and when you ve managed to pull off the optional stuff you do feel like you ve accomplished something. You essentially feel like a pilot stationed at Vega. The gameplay systems are well rounded and well balanced. To survive the end-game you need to master all of them and also adeptly trick the AI.

Metro 2033 Redux, I picked up this and Last Light and kind of burned through them because the story was compelling. This one the first one is pretty good introducing an interesting environment: some supernatural mixed with WW2-shooter style tropes. Love the focus on immersion by presenting third-party conversations between residents or enemies. I didn t get much use out of the stealth system in this one because it didn t appear useful to the outcome of the game. Minor spoiler: it turns out that there s a hidden game mechanic that playing stealthy leading to knocking out instead of killing helps trigger. I can understand why they left the workings of the mechanic hidden because the idea of mentally checking accomplishment boxes does kind of break immersion which is bad in a game like this where it helps to have your mind really focused on the story. Still I feel like it could have gotten a little more attention to help swing players away from shooting everything that moves. The weapons variance is pretty good. Some customization but only a small amount. Unfortunately unless you ve played the game once before you won t know what style of weapons to focus on for the upcoming chapter. Having three different guns helps but if a person needs to buy bullets they won t know which ones to buy. I guess the outcome of my review is that the game is worth it but there are situations where things aren t explained and a search engine comes to the rescue. Considering the refinement in the sequel in gameplay and plot keeps this at a solid four. , October 23 2018, I picked up this and Last Light and kind of burned through them because the story was compelling,drake,a

However in multiplayer when you can concentrate on one or two people you can really get to enjoy the game. My massive gripe with this game is that it hides the save games in a weird hidden folder in your app-data folder somewhere. This is utterly absurd when you have a perfectly you  My Gamesfolder in your user documents made for save games. This means that my brothers and I have lost our saves in our computer migrations windows crashes etc unaware that the saves were there.

Removing free pointer movement from an RTS is a boneheaded handicap: every game boils down to singular suicide rushes as movement and staggering strategies are impossible mid-encounter due to the extremely slow pointer mechanic. The Advance and Retreat commands are not coded versatile enough to execute even basic tactics - Overlord did this better in 2007 and it even had to deal with a 3D playing field.

Moebius: Empire Rising, This is a game that reminds me that cheap does not always mean crappy. If you are looking for a PnC adventure game with a good story innovative puzzles and smooth actions that actually make sense in the context of the story look no further. Jane Jensen s games are always top notch when it comes to story as she writes her stories from the perspective of a novelist. Too many adventure games construct a story as merely a frame to hold actions and puzzles but in Jane s games story and character development is primary. In this game all of the actions you have to figure out make good sense in the context of the story and one doesn t have to feel like they have to read the developer s mind to figure out what to do. I may have looked at a walkthrough once in the game I think and that was only lack of patience on my part. The puzzles are ingenious as they are mainly related to the role of the protagonist as an analyzer of people and patterns. You won t find any slidey puzzles here. I also like that the player is switched back and forth between playing either of two main characters. It gives variety and a nice break from the pomposity of the main protagonist. That being said I found Malachi s personality very amusing probably because I do not personally know anyone like him. Her game Grey Matter had the same kind of character switching mechanic. I really really hope that we see more content coming from Jane in the future. Another plus is that this game (as of 2018) is fairly old now and you can find it for very low prices during sales and bundled with other games at sites like Fanatic and Humble Bundle.

Death To Spies: Moment Of Truth, Unfortunately I can t agree with the other reviews of this game. Having played several other stealth titles including the older entries of the Splinter Cell series (up to Double Agent) Hitman 2 Thief 3: Deadly Shadows and Desperados 2 I find this game to be unplayably clunky. In a stealth game you should be able to stab/choke/strangle an enemy when sneaking up on him from behind without having to try 10 times and only succeeding once because of the obscure controls. Also there is no hit feedback (blood hit marker) and the weapon handling is nothing short of terrible even compared to really old games like Mafia 1.

Signal Ops, Comparing this to Rainbow Six or whatever is pointless - it just isn t that kind of game. Stands completely by itself - if you must classify it I d say it s a stealth-action-tactics game. NOT shooter at all. Weapons are purposely inaccurate to prevent turning it into one. OTOH melee weapons kill with one blow - as does the sniper with his rifle. If you want to rush in guns blazing - forget it. Not the game for you. If you prefer striking from behind or avoiding enemies altogether - you re in for a treat! What makes it completely different are graphics humour and well ... signal ops. Everything looks like painted in water colours. In days of photo-realism not sure if this was due to budget constraints but it works great - esp. with the overall humour tone. It definitely doesn t take itself too seriously - in spite of the dystopian world. UI is deliberately wonky de/briefings really hilarious and agentsdrivel quite funny. It s fun to play and I really enjoy its vibe. The most unique feature though is what the game s name suggests: you control your (2 to 4) agents remotely and see only what their cameras see. These have quite limited transmit range though so you have to move your single transceiver around to keep agents in its range. Well you *can* blindly send an agent anywhere you want and if he manages to find his own way there - cool. If he gets stuck or killed while you don t see through his camera - need to try something different. Perhaps even restart level with different agents. Another thing is transceiver needs power and works less than a minute on battery while you carry it to a new power source. And THIS is what makes the game so hard intriguing and completely different from anything else out there. Still has some minor bugs but NOTHING as bad than mentioned for the early versions. Unique fun if you have the patience for it - I love it and find it worth every penny. But if you look for a FPS or some serious tactical assault keep looking. , April 16 2017, Comparing this to Rainbow Six or whatever is pointless - it just isn t that kind of game,kemp,a
Enter The Gungeon, When I first played Enter the Gungeon before any updates I did not like the game at all. It felt slow and while the aethstic and gameplay were great each run took forever to start rolling. After the two updates Supply Drop and Advanced Gungeons &amp; Draguns I could not be more addicted. The developers rebalanced the loot table and added hundreds of item synergies. This makes it exciting to pick up everything and anything as you never know what might have a synergy. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the formula of these style of games and also enjoys a bullet hell style challenge. , October 3 2018, When I first played Enter the Gungeon before any updates I did not like the game at all,mckay8026,a
Mages Of Mystralia, Everything about Mages of Mystralia is technically functional but does not add up to a very entertaining whole. Everything you ll see here you will have seen already seen in other games and done better. Graphics look nice sound is okay the bosses are a minor highlight but can drag on with extremely telegraphed attacks and no possibility to speed up the battle as you can only hit them within per-determined breaks of their attack loops. The one thing Mystralia has going for it is the ability to combine different spells to create new spells. Majority of them are rather situational however and mostly used to solve puzzles to gather upgrades wich are hardly necessary to progress as the game s difficulty is rather low. Plot &amp; characters are underwhelming combat feels clunky movement is like slipping on soap. It has the feel of a typical current era low budget 3D game it reminded me a lot of Stories Path of Destinies. There are certainly worse games you could be playing but I can t see anything worth recommending here either. Play Hob instead if you want a decent Action Adventure with light puzzle solving or maybe Ittle Dew if you want challenging puzzles. , September 17 2018, Everything about Mages of Mystralia is technically functional but does not add up to a very entertaining whole,alvarez2570,a

Space Rogue, Like FTL but different enough to be fun. Therefore here are the differences to FTL: - 3D ships - you have to mine Tritanium in order to upgrade your ship - you can revisit sectors and systems - unlimited fuel supply This stuff needs to be unlocked first : - different missions - you can choose to have a limited number of jumps - choose the size of the galaxy - up to two perks for your ship My only complains are the mining part as there is no way to improve your chances here which makes it quite hit or miss and that there is no manual as some parts of the game are not self-explanatory. , May 4 2018, Like FTL but different enough to be fun,price,a
Neurovoider, Yeah. That pretty much sums it up. For those who haven t played either of those arcade classics this game mixes the best of both. Randomly generated mazes and loot mixed with twin stick shooter madness. A wide variety of weapons pumpinsoundtrack vivid colors and a customizeable portagonist makes for an awesome game I can pick up and not be able to put down right when I need to. The levels play out quickly even the large ones. Since all maps are generated on a scale of 1-5 with 3 stats (size # of elite enemies and amount of loot) I ve found tiny maps packed with loot and elites give the best return on time investment. You have 3 classes of robots to choose from a melee  bot a tank  bot and a middle of the road gun  bot. Each one demands unique tactics so there s lots of room to experiment. Boss battles are a little on the bogus side. Once you figure them out they re easy enough but they re kind of all the same. Loot sorting is a simple affair that I ve figured out well enough that I can pare down my recent haul to a couple keepers and the rest gets turned into credits for upgrades. There s 4 types of parts for your robot Sensors generators movement and weapons all upgradable by 5 steps. I ve found a few types of the weapons to be my favorite so I tend to use them most often. I ve begun forcing myself to give the others a shot and they re pretty fun once you get used to them. I ve even tried a few silly combinations and they can be surprisingly effective (try double mounting twin beams or rocket launchers) to absolutely useless ( like twin blades). Everyone gushes about the music and while I won t say it s bad it does get repetetive quickly. Overall I love this game. It s easy to pick up and play for `5 minutes but it s kept me busy for hours. , July 29 2018, Yeah,justice1991,a

Last Day Of June, Last Day of June is a puzzle game in which you try to find a way to save June. Your wife June not the month. The gimmick of this game is taking control of other characters during one day changing the behaviour of characters to try and prevent certain events. The art is great aside from the crazy amount of Depth of Field they used for some reason. Certain scenes just look extremely strange due to this. The few scenes where you drive a car just felt bad. The gameplay is just... walking towards stuff and interacting. There s a few collectibles spread out over the map which you ll get access to as you progress. The game can be frustrating as the nature of it ensures you will see certain cutscenes more than once. You cannot skip them or speed them up in any way. Even if a cutscene is 3-5 seconds this can get extremely frustrating. The slow walking speed of characters does not help either. The frustration I occasionally felt while playing Last Day of June did not erase the charm it has definitely a game you should play. , June 4 2018, Last Day of June is a puzzle game in which you try to find a way to save June,santos6492,a

Scanner Sombre, I love exploring caves in real life it s very exciting interesting and challenging. From the other reviews I understood that there wasn t much in the way of story or combat and I was okay with that. But at a bare minimum I expected the game to recreate the awesome experience of exploring a subterranean world in a brand new way. Unfortunately it does not do this. The game is totally unrealistic and makes exploring a cave seem like a walk in the park. I can think of so many ways they could have made the game a lot more interesting (without involving combat) but they didn t do any of it. Normally games try to be MORE interesting than reality but I was shocked to find the caves in this game are much LESS interesting than most in the real world! Not to mention the other problems such as the inexplicably lit-up pickups which seem to negate the game s central premise. I really regret buying this game there s just nothing to it aside from a cashgrab. , June 25 2018, I love exploring caves in real life it s very exciting interesting and challenging,robles1927,a
Gateways, The first part of the game is pretty much what you expect from a combination of a platformer and Portal. The puzzles are well designed will make you think hard. And then you get the Time Gun. When you get the Time Gun the puzzles are still well designed but if you aren t a God at Platforming then executing the solutions will be infuriating. The Time Gun allows you to record a short amount of you gameplay so you can say hit two buttons at once one with your previous gameplay and one with your current. However you will need to overlap 234 sometimes 5 recordings all over each other meaning you need a degree of precision in planning jumping and timing that can be almost impossible. If you mess up at all you have to start it all over again. The solutions can be worked out. But completing them is another story. If you aren t a master at platforming give this one a miss. , May 10 2016, The first part of the game is pretty much what you expect from a combination of a platformer and Portal,farrell7716,a

The Sexy Brutale, I bought it because I like original settings and mechanics and this game sure provides that. However as someone who also likes to peacefully roam across the isle of The Witness and solve tons of logical puzzles at my own pace I didn t get much pleasure out of this game. What you basically do is run trough a mansion and watch what the NPCs are doing. After 5 or so minutes everything starts from the beginning. Your task is figuring out a plan to prevent a murder the next time the clock starts. So unlike regular adventure games you can t really try out stuff because after five minutes you lose your entire progress anyway or because you have to wait several minutes until a NPC does a specific action. Even though you can t really lose this game there is just too much time pressure. The fact that sometimes only one or two (rather illogical) actions suffice to reach the goal helps but ... the lack of content should normally not be an upside of a game. Also the story and style is a little too weird for my taste. On the one hand you have silly jokes and child-like proportions and character animations but on the other hand life crises murder and suicides. , October 31 2018, I bought it because I like original settings and mechanics and this game sure provides that,hanson,a
Bastard, It s less glitched and bugged than the Legends of Eisenwald. I have a beast of PC and the Legends worked good on it but in the Bastard windows and dialogues are hellishly slow. You don t lose your army and equipment between missions which is a great improvement. Story is extremely linear not engaging and dull. Legends of Eisenwald is great for it s fight mechanics and story atmosphere etc and Bastard lacks in story and don t have a lot of fights. SPOILERish thing below!!! At the end you have 3 options and first one (perhaps the best one) is locked behind reputation (or renown?) level so high that you literally need to chose reputation beneficial dialogue options through the entire game.

The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky The 3rd, Having never played the [i]Trails[/i] series before I decided to take a risk and drop $10 on the first in the series. Here I am six months later having just finished the third game. In all I have a good 120 hours play time just on this series. It is fun with a story that -- like most JRPGs -- keeps growing over time hinting at an epic scope but never quite revealing its entirety. Now more specifically about the third game: [i]The 3rd[/i] is a delightful romp through purgatory and Hell. Your main character is unlike in the first two games Father Kevin Graham a member of the priesthood with a secret only hinted at in the second chapter. Uniting friends and foes alike you tear your way through demons to uncover the secret of this world in which you find yourself trapped. If you ve played the first two games you will know what to expect in play style: turn-based strategy with a mixture of physical attacks arts (magic) and crafts as well as items. Everyone s S-crafts are expanded upon and new orbments are included to expand the charactersrange of abilities. In the exploration there are also a number of entirely skippable doors that allow you to play minigames or get insight into lives of the characters. As mentioned in another review this is not quite a sequel but rather a lengthy epilogue to the [i]Trails in the Sky[/i] series and a farewell to the Liberl crew. It gives them a sense of closure and sets up a number of plot points that are expanded upon in the [i]Cold Steel[/i] series and in some yet-to-be-translated games that I really hope end up on GOG in the near future. In short -- if you loved the first two games buy this. If you haven t played them: play them first then buy this. , August 19 2018, Having never played the [i]Trails[/i] series before I decided to take a risk and drop $10 on the first in the series,oneal5976,a

Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms, I d say it s a nice hybrid between a ARPG and a Moba. Why? Let me explain. The game offers a choice between 3 startingheroes. The standard fair of meele ranged and mage. But in a stroke of genius you are able to devour the souls of other heroes along the way of your journey. All of these heroes come with an archetype coresponding to the startingchoices But all of them have their own story and their own skills. You can then setup a party of 3+1 heroes which you can shuffle through on the fly. This allows you to combo the skills of your chosen party. Use a aoe-slow that reduces fireresistance change to your aoe-firemage to place a DoT on the enemys to then change into your meele-goon to quickly dispatch the big unit after the adds die. Every gauntlet is basically a mini-teamfight where you switch between the roles. On top of that allmost all skills are a aimed skillshot while enemys have clear wind-up attacks or projectile-attacks which strongly encourages you to dodge their attacks by movement. Concepts like orb-walking/kiteing or dodgeing with skills are something you will pick up naturally by playing this. Braindead clicking while standing still basically attritionwarfare like in a lot of other ARPGs is strongly discouraged espescially on higher difficulties. Add the bossfights on top of that which usually have bullethell elements incorporated into the fights and you have one very interesting and engageing game. This is a full on remake in a better engine includeing both the first part that was allready available and the second part. The engine brings about a nice graphicsupgrade and more importanlty makes the game run way smoother and more responsive. It s just a joy to play espescially if you made your way through the first 2014 release. All around a very good job by the devs and Kalypso who gave the game out to those who bought the 2014 release FOR FREE.

If you ve played Dark Souls or it s clones you know what to expect for better or for worse. Traps difficult combat and more.

Starpoint Gemini 2, The game runs well looks good and has lots of mechanics that sound cool - but is very confusing at best. So there are 50 factions but it would make no difference if it had just been 5 since they don??t have anything that sets them apart from each other except their label. The controls feel awkward and most of the time enemy ships fly just out of sight while your laser turrets take them dowm automaticly. The story fails to captivate and the characters don??t mean anything to you while the endless mode is pointless and generic. I love space-sims but this one is a mayor disapointment. Maybe the game??s meant for experienced gamers that have plaed the first part of the series but to a newcomer it??s just a mess of joyless features that would have benefitted from a much tighter design a tutorial or first chapter that actually introduces players to the gameplay and the in-game-world and from a story that gives you something to care about. , April 2 2018, The game runs well looks good and has lots of mechanics that sound cool - but is very confusing at best,case,a
Slime Rancher," Is Slime Rancher a cute game? Absolutely. The sound effects the colorful environments and the bouncy slimes are all very squee-worthy. Once you get past the visual adorableness it almost turns into a first-person clicker-game.

Trine 3: The Artifacts Of Power, I was worried the addition of the third dimension would ruin the gameplay but good golly it made it even more beautiful! There was some really magical camera work that could not have been done in the earlier games. Every scene is a piece of artwork in itself! The Trine series consistently gives me a feeling of magic that I haven t had since I was a kid--amazing! The puzzles were indeed easier than the rest of the series but I enjoyed that: they made you think but they weren t hard enough to get stuck on.

The devs are silent about Bombshell (or even ignore it) and there is still no any official statement about the state of this project.

The Little Acre, Took me about 1.75 hours of relaxed playing to get through this short playing time is the main reason for my only 4 star rating. It s a really easy and straight-forward game to play there s no 200-item inventory no countdown action no sliding puzzles (THANK YOU!) sensible auto-highlighting of objects and I think I saw a button to click for hints somewhere but I never needed it. The walking speed isn t annoying the characters don t nag and there are ZERO puzzles that make you cross the entire world pick an item up there cross the entire world back again to apply it to something else and then let you walk all the way back again to see what it did. THANK YOU for that also. It s a bit shallow at times especially regarding the story or background plot.

Dream, I was excited to get this game but within 10 minutes of loading it experienced extreme nausea. Going into options I was dismayed to not see any option for FOV slider or to toggle off the head bob movement of the avatar. There was an option to hide the avatar and make it first person which helped but the head bob persisted. Resorting to steam there were threads regarding this issue where the dev responded that he was working on the solution however that was in 2015 and the game more or less seems abandoned. A Steam user offered a workaround by modifying ini console line but when I tried that option it crashed the game. Gog as always was prompt in responding to my issue and when no workaround was available offered a refund. What I saw of the game was very basic graphic and art the voice over was good and intriguing but the rooms were pretty empty of actions you could pick up a picture or two turn on lights open a door. Thats it. Was not too impressed with what I saw but was hopeful the atmosphere story and puzzles would boost its rating. , December 6 2016, I was excited to get this game but within 10 minutes of loading it experienced extreme nausea,gill,a
Men Of War: Red Tide, Amazing game! I loved Assault Squad for multiplayer but this is awesome for singleplayer experience. Game is very hard but not impossible. It s just needs a lot of learning and get used to save and load missions over and over again. It seems to be that AI is little more stupid than in Assault Squad. Specially for shooting enemies without orders in trenches. Otherwise it does it s job well. Voice acting in this game is awful like in every MOW game. The best way to make the game more enjoyable is install game first in English language copy localization.pak file to e.g. desktop. Then uninstall game and install it again in Russian language place localization.pak from desktop to game folder and you get English texts and subtitles but voice acting is in Russian which is much more better. , October 5 2016, Amazing game!

Tyranny - Bastard S Wound, Bastard s Wound adds a new location with a multilevel dungeon and adds companion quest for three of the companions. The latter is the best addition the expansion provides. The new location is fine - if you liked the Oldwalls sections from the base game it is a more elaborate version of that. However lack of unique enemies mean that it suffers from the very same issues the base game did - dull combat. There is quite a bit of ambition to the main quest behind Bastard s Wound but game suffers from noticable design problems - quest cutting each other forcing you to ally with certain side of a conflict without you making that choice small quests which have a major bearing on the conclusion too easy to miss if you wont backtrack to certain locations which for all you know are completed. I would recommend picking it up if you are planing to play or replay Tyranny. Not worth returning to the game just for the new content though. , June 11 2018, Bastard s Wound adds a new location with a multilevel dungeon and adds companion quest for three of the companions,blanchard,a

Apotheon, A very satisfying experience. If you love Greek mythology look no further than this game. The main selling point for me was the art style satisfying combat mechanics and perfect soundtrack all which contribute to a very immersive and atmospheric game.

Crosscode, I just completed the game and it was a lot of fun! I - as a person how grew up with the old Nintendo and Sega consoles - enjoyed this game really much. It has all the things I like about old JRPGs like Secret of Mana Chrono Trigger etc. and adds modern elements to it. Everyone who likes named JRPGs should really check this game out. It is lovely designed has very likable characters challenging puzzles and a good story with a plot twist in the middle and a beautiful ending. There are even a lot of treasures and interesting quests to find. The quest design is also very great and diverse. The combat is very balanced and fun! No button smashing and rock/paper/scissors principal. Conclusion: Everything you need! The only thing I have to criticize is the aiming with the XBOX Controller. You aim with the right analog stick and unfortunately the aim position seem to lock every 45??. This is really troublesome when you need to aim in between during fast combat or time limited puzzles. I had to switch to mouse at some points to be able to aim fast and precise. What some players might want to know: I needed some time to get used to all the mechanics and the crafting system at first. It has a lot of mechanics. You have to try everything out and after a while you get used to everything and later on everything becomes second nature. The game also explains every new skill and mechanic at an appropriate time - with the option to reread and redo every tutorial. Very convenient! Backtracking and grinding makes also a small part of the game. You don t have to grind - which is nice - but makes things a little easier ;) The game is nearly perfect for me. I really wish I could give 5 stars - but I have to give very honest 49 stars due to the controller issue! , November 5 2018, I just completed the game and it was a lot of fun!

Celestian Tales: Old North, This is a really fun game if you know what you re getting into. It s essentially a simple jrpg style game with a strong focus on characters &amp; story (but mainly characters.) The gameplay is fun but not complicated and is largely exactly what you d expect from this genre. The main reason to play it is because of the six protagonists. You get to choose any of the six as the main character and the other five become your companions for the rest of the game (there are no other recruitable companions.) They re all charming in different ways and I personally enjoy the character dynamics and was always looking forward to the next conversation. (Be careful which character you choose as you will have to keep them in your party for the entire game.) One important note though: It s very short especially for an rpg. I completed my first playthrough in about 8 hours and while you are likely meant to replay it multiple times playing as the different characters it still feels a little limited. There are also very very few choices. From my memory my Lucienne playthrough only had two choices in the whole thing but I am not sure if the other characters have more. Also the ending while engaging &amp; surprising was also a little confusing but this might be something meant to be explored in the next game. tl;dr: if you like short character driven rpgs you will probably enjoy it. , June 21 2018, This is a really fun game if you know what you re getting into,fox9567,a
Shantae: Half-Genie Hero Ultimate Edition, I enjoyed this game enough to want to play the other ones in the series. Pirate s Curse has quickly become one of my favorite platformers ever. I prefer it over Half-Genie Hero for about a hundred different reasons that aren t worth listing here. I will mention that this game sacrifices the open level design of the previous two for something much more linear. The controls also don t feel quite as good but I m not sure why. In Pirate s Curse I can breeze through levels that I once thought were impossible but I consistently feel a bit clumsy in Half-Genie Hero even after several playthroughs. They ve added a bunch of free DLC costumes (as separate modes) that change the gameplay drastically. They re all pretty fun but they do mean playing through the same levels as the main game again so that can get old after a while. Really I would recommend the entire series [never played the first one]. Each one brings something different to the table. Risky s Revenge has some of the most innovative mechanics and level design; Pirate s Curse has the tightest gameplay my favorite character art and some of the best writing; and HGH takes us into high-def land with 3D environments and super smooth animations. The writing is consistently funny throughout all three games. So pick your poison I guess. But Pirate s Curse is the best.... , August 5 2018, I enjoyed this game enough to want to play the other ones in the series,dejesus,a
Telepath Tactics," Another reviewer compared this game to an ""ugly ugly diamond"". I tend to agree. I love the concept the tactical aspects and the overall theme. While FF Tactics is the most common comparison I actually think this game has far more in common with the Shining Force games in terms of strategy and story. Tactically the game emphasises positioning and facing of characters. All attacks do backstab damage from behind (*all* including spells and area attacks). So it becomes critical early on to learn how to use push and pull abilities to position enemies and allies. Other than a few duplicate classes each unit has distinct strengths and vulnerabilities which make it interesting enough to use and strong enough to be worth using. Unfortunately the game is both incomplete and extremely buggy. Despite over 50 hours in the game I ve given up on playing it due to a bug that causes the game to slow incrementally during play until it progresses at a snail s pace of a few frames per second. You may notice that the most positive reviews here don t pass the game s earlier stages which are shorter and don t demonstrate the problem. In addition the UI is a disaster. Everything from font choice to background makes the UI a pain to use. Buttons can go beyond the boxes they re meant to fit in to hover over the battlefield. Dropping an item can cause other items to unequip. Sometimes items swap between characters for no apparent reason. I ve spent some serious time with a decompiler trying to figure out why the game behaves so poorly over time but it s an art I haven t mastered. For now all I can suggest is to wait and see if the developer ever finishes this new engine that he claimed to be working on several years ago but has yet to deliver.

Capitalism Plus, Sim games have always intrigued me yet I never really got into them. Apart from running a zoo running a theme park and controlling the lives of a small family their subject didn t interest me. I have no desire to build or maintain a city fly a realistic looking airplane or make trains run on time. I do however want to run a business. Working retail for most of my life the divide between a worker and a business owner always intrigued me. It seemed like a big leap to go from one to the other although it really isn t. But playing Capitalism Plus I figured I d get to experience it without having to you know go outside and actually try. Sadly for what it is Capitalism Plus is extremely low in options. You only get a few businesses you can run and in all of them you fairly much build everything there is to build and watch the money pour in. I never felt like I was building a proper business but rather that I was given a template. I guess it s the difference between starting a business and opening yet another store in a franchise. Success isn t very hard and any action you make doesn t seem to have much effect on the course your business takes. Although I don t enjoy the over-involved over-complicated simulation games I wanted a bit more. Success or failure seemed to be down to luck and having a slump sometimes it seemed like I could simply wait it out. Every department in your business is well defined every employee knows what they are doing and your business runs itself. You re not needed. It just isn t very fun. , December 30 2017, Sim games have always intrigued me yet I never really got into them,herman,a

Prodigy Tactics, I pre-purchased the game but waited until after I tried the full release to write this review. First of all graphics are amazing. That and the obvious effort put in improving the game are the two reasons I am not giving it a single star. The leveling table is exactly the same for all characters. No individuality except for the very basics. The game play is still slow (even after the devs put in the option to skip the terribly repetitive attacks animations; I did give them credit for listening to the community on this one). Also the game play is just incredibly boring as there are no real decisions to be made (if you are sticking to optimal game play I mean). And this is coming from somebody who loves tactical games. The story mode is simply... lacking? Seriously the way the storytelling is implemented seems kind of rushed/lazy compared to how good the graphics are. Overall: good effort amazing graphics boring game play lazy story telling lazy level-up system. I kind of feel I am being too generous giving it 3 stars to be honest. 2.5 would be more fair. , October 17 2018, I pre-purchased the game but waited until after I tried the full release to write this review,bond,a

Outlast," This game stands out as being something truly special: it creates an athmosphere that is truly frightening. From the moment I entered the courtyard and got out from the car I knew that I had something special in front of me. The feeling is perfect: being not able to fight your way and having only the option to run and avoid the enemies you feel helpless; and having to constantly manage the battery level only increases the tension (here I fondly remember the flashlight from Doom 3). The graphics are nice the sound is awesome (you can easily hear your breathing how it changes depending on the circumstances) the movement is smooth and the story is decent. I consider the game to be pegged in reality until the end. I didn t like the ending: whereas everything until the end was pretty ""normal"" and doable we get the supernatural thing as a game-end explanation. I don t get it: why couldn t they keep the line with the asylum crazy doctors maybe a little conspiracy? Do we need a new invisible enemy walking through walls and flying like Superman? This is not a good ending: this is lazy story telling period. I like to abide to this rule: if it ain t broken don t fix it. And let me not forget that the new super invincible and invisible enemy had my fears disappear: the scare factor was lost gone was the authentic horror feeling only the tension to run away from this ""thing"" remained. Quite a difference between the game (until this point) and the ending. It is my personal opinion that had it stayed in the realm of earth it would ve been a perfect horror game.

Necropolis: Brutal Edition, It s about combat right? No. It s about something else.

Zenith," Ok. First: Watch the trailer video. Listen to the voiceover. Did you laugh out loud? Good. This game s dialog and writng has that same sense of humor throughout and it is the game s strongest feature. (sadly that voice actor does not do Argusmain dialog. I would have rated that delivery at 5 stars regardless of other game flaws.) The good: sense of humor (see above) story: solid writing. Classic tropes from fantasy and RPGs abound and are deconstructed fairly logically throughout this game. Characterization: The characters tend to be genre-savvy and intelligent. They are capable of making mistakes and dumb decisions but those are typically in keeping with established character traits and a deep underlying assumption that other charaters are NOT as genre-savvy and intelligent as they are. The Bad Skills: All of the skills are passives (increase to elemental damage/resistance an extra hit in your combos etc...) Worse you re going to get all of them. The level cap stops you two points short of maxxing out every ability. No replay value no trying different builds. General UI: The game has a single volume slider for everything instead of separate music/sfx controls. The music drowns out the sfx at times. The Ugly: Controls: This is a console port and the controller support needs work. There is at least one puzzle that is almost but not quite unplayable because you can t adjust controller sensitivity. (You need to drop an object in front of a stream of fire to block it but the object s hitbox is small and the controller goes from ""don t move"" to ""dive into the fire"".) Bugs: -I had to replay the final boss fight because I hit him too hard. -I had to reload during a dungeon because I stepped off the side of a stone bridge and was trapped on an invisibe platform. I rate this game highly because the story is solid and the humor is GOOD. Good enough for me to forgive the clunky interface the hard to aim attacks and the honestly bad gameplay.

Triple Town," This is essentially the same as the Android/iOS version but you d be forgiven for thinking that this version is level-based because it makes you play through levels to reach a target score for quite a long time before it lets you play the game on ""endless"" mode which is probably all you wanted to begin with. This version also makes you build some kind of ""permanent"" capital city on a different island. I m not sure why anyone would want to do that but it s there and it s not too distracting. The capital city is also your hub for sailing to other islands each of which is one of the modes from the mobile version. Overall it s nicely put together and it would be hard to criticize if you hadn t played another version. You can still close it and resume your game later. I think that using the Item Store is cheating and that feature is prominent in this version. Each mode should be available without this ""pay to win"" feature even if it s not real money.

Hacknet - Labyrinths," (Below is a slightly modified version of my original review of  Hacknet: Labyrinthson Steam. I love the game so much that I purchased another copy on GOG just for the DRM-free version.) @54.188.232.231&gt; addNote Note: Dear Diary It has been a couple of weeks since I last booted up my computer. The last time I used it I was introduced to a hacker named Bit. Somehow he had installed HacknetOS into my computer. Before I could figure out what had happened I found myself in the company of other hackers in Entropy and CSEC. The adventures that I subsequently had are still vividly etched in my mind. I tried to fight the urge to further get involved in the affairs of Entropy and CSEC. The ""work"" that they do was dangerous yet exciting; illegal yet morally justifiable in some cases. I ll be honest: I like how HacknetOS gives me the power to snoop inside other people s computers and phones. The allure of HacknetOS specifically the PortHack tool is just too strong for me to resist. Before I knew it I found myself once again logged into CSEC s contract server. Some guy named Kaguya is recruiting. Little did I know my curiosity about Kaguya s trials quickly pulled me into deep labyrinths of computer networks one again. Soon after that I found myself in a trio of hackers and started taking missions from Kaguya. The missions technically were very similar to what I took on with CSEC earlier. Thankfully the purposes of the missions and the scenarios were different enough to keep things interesting for me. I needed to think type and react faster than before. The missions required me to dig deep to find hidden (i.e. deleted) secrets. The best was that I got some new tools to help me navigate these ""labyrinths"" such as FTPSprint which is WAY faster than FTPBounce. If only I had these wonderful toys at my disposal when I was part of CSEC! It was a nice change to work alongside teammates but I wish I had the ability or time to really chat with them. Even though we were a team it still felt like I was working alone. They did help me out a couple of times and I do wish I could learn what tricks they had up their sleeves. Still in spite of our communicating via Kaguya s IRC channel working for Kaguya was still a lonely insulated experience as before. In the end working for Kaguya was thrilling albeit it being a brief experience. I did not feel my time was wasted and it felt great put my hacking skills to good use once more. Somehow I feel like I d hear from Kaguya again for better or worse.

Zwei: The Arges Adventure," Still my favorite Falcom game (""Gurumin"" are good ""Trails"" series are better but this is still my favorite). You starts by naming main characters and picking your pet! Then you go between villages and dungeons to challenge cute monsters and collect lots of drops to level up. Who doesn t like some good drops and leveling up?

The Universim, Definitly in Alpha. Its a lot of fun up until the medeival era and then the game just grinds to a halt. There is nothing to do after that point. There is missing tooltips but the AI is good. I would say the game is too easy. Ive literally walked away for 30+ minutes and my population went up. I build a bunch of water pumps wells reservoir hospitals and farms and my nuggets do very well without me. Not much micromanagement really needed.

Escape Goat, Not based on GOG version; review written with main course completed. Escape Goat is one of those little games that do one thing but do it extremely well. So while little it s an awesome game. I finished Prison Of Angus in a bit less than 3h30m with 347 deaths and all rooms cleared. That is my only  butfor this game it s quite short. Thankfully there s a pack of extra levels unlocked after completion of the main course as well as being able to add more user-made levels and a sequel of course. Briefly EG is a nice blend of platformer and puzzle where you must reach the exit of each room. I instantly made the connection with Solomon s Key although in EG the platform side is way stronger. Besides jumping ramming and pressing buttons you have a small mouse as your companion which will climb walls and trigger stuff for you too. You can t attack enemies but you can use traps to indirectly kill them. It seems like there s a lack of elements but trust me there are enough and the levels are cleverly designed to exploit them - against you. The pixelated oldschool graphics are nice and together with the synthy soundtrack they give an overall retro ambience and feeling. The movements are fast and while you might not like that your goat has a little bit of inertia it adds to the whole experience. And already mentioned the levels are well done offering challenge for both reflexes and brain. As conclusion exactly what I said in the beginning: simple but awesome game. Pros: awesome platforming puzzler room based; deceptively simple but enticing gameplay; few elements but lots of combinations including your rodent companion; superb mix of both thought and skill. Decent: synth music pixel graphics (both are cool but not that great anyway). Cons: quite short. Recommended if: you like or want to try platform puzzlers; you have a gamepad (not needed but it s nicer); you miss Solomon s Key. Not recommended if: you don t like platform puzzlers. , February 13 2018, Not based on GOG version; review written with main course completed,kline9436,a

Niche - A Genetics Survival Game, So here you are you start out (depending on) with one or two of these little guys and you mainly have a single mission which is to keep them alive until you either breed enough more or capture others to keep your tribe going. Along the way you re attempting to breed for various skills and genetics trying to manipulate mutant genes by choosing what you want to happen. There are other oddities in the genetics too like just out of the blue one will be born with something I ve never seen before nor shows up in their genes and certainly isn t available in the mutations. In keeping them alive they have to eat (this is where skills are helpful) and there s a variety of food sources and certain of them can be easier to obtain using a little strategy. You ll encounter hazards and potential illnesses that can shorten their lifespan (don t leave one sitting under a coconut tree because dropping coconuts will potentially daze them and take a day from their life) or your poor females get bred by a rogue male (which from what I ve seen always have the Derp nose) or they might get parasites etc. etc. On the surface all that stuff sounds pretty interesting doesn t it? And it is but here s the rub. Your animals are like game pieces. Each one can make exactly three moves per turn on their game board which is made up of hexagon-shaped spaces. You will spend the majority of your time clearing out grass because you can t move through it well and the other largest part collecting food (basically you end up needing dedicated food gatherers and pity anyone who gets two starters with high fishing skill but no other skill because they will likely starve to death). Ultimately it s not a bad game but it does get extremely repetitive in fairly short order. , September 10 2018, So here you are you start out (depending on) with one or two of these little guys and you mainly have a single mission which is to keep them alive until you either breed enough more or capture others to keep your tribe going,osborne8332,a

Cinders," I can t say that Visual Novels are my cup of tea in general. I did enjoy most of Taleworldsgames but have not been actively looking for anything new in that genre. I bought Cinders right after Solstice and bought Solstice mostly because I admired the work clearly put into the artwork. Enough to take a ""two Starbucks coffee"" risk on a game anyway. The storytelling of Solstice was enough to buy Cinders in turn. I was not disappointed. While the game formula ends up being a few choice-making points in the game (the actual number varies depending on your selection) this is mostly a game based on reading. If you are bothered by having to read dialogues in RPG games... well this probably is not a good pick for you. The storytelling is excellent. The characters are well crafted and the ability to see several of their sides depending on your choices along made me replay the game twice immediately after finishing it for the first time. I absolutely love the graphical presentation (the amount of details that went into each background scene genuinely deserves calling them a work of art). There are enough plot twists to keep one interested (especially in alternative playthroughs) and it s a solid and fitting re-imagining of the old folk tale. My only disappointment was the (understandably from technical point of view) limited amount of branching. I d love to see even more possibilities but even without those I already found Cinders experience highly engaging and pleasant. Though I refuse to play for the ""bad"" endings. I came to like the characters too much. Definitely recommend for people who enjoy reading a well crafted plot and strong characterization even if a single playthrough is a rather short experience.

The Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsing: Final Cut, More then just a simple classic monster dungeon slashing game this title is a steampunk heaven dark story filled trip with cheesy lines to lighten the mood and more references to pop culture then one could recognize. Beautiful graphics free high res texture DLC pack and fitting victorian gothic music. Great and varied level design. Lots of different monster types and a huge variety of unique classes and abilities to get rid of such monsters. Levels full of hidden content that require some careful exploration. On top of giving you a nice companion that can be upgraded to different roles and utilities you soon get to manage a base filled with strange characters and a tower defense minigame if you fancy otherwise send your captains to do your dirty work. Game is accessible by everyone not familiar with the genre with a friendly casual difficulty option that feels like godmode. Normal diificulty allows to finish the game without having to min-max gear or have to fiddle with gear enhanchments or gold farming. Controller is supported but camera zoom and rotation are not available. Additional adventure mode allows to play random generated missions that vary in difficulty and can be a great challenge for those wishing to continue slashing monsters. The game crashes randomly in the item enchanting menu with no available fixes on GoG Steam or the developers forum. Controller bug makes navigating the radial equipment menu a pain. , June 19 2017, More then just a simple classic monster dungeon slashing game this title is a steampunk heaven dark story filled trip with cheesy lines to lighten the mood and more references to pop culture then one could recognize,baird,a
Wizard Of Legend, I really wanted to like this game. It s a roguelike / lite with RPG customisation options. Great sell. I like the combat I like the tutorial section. Nice theme nice art cool selection of powers. I can t get past the controls. Specifically the jumping / dashing. I found myself losing more health to the platforming sections than the enemies and that s not a good thing. The game is hard - that s what we re here for.

Hand Of Fate 2, While there are improvements in HoF2 there are also frustrations with it. First Combat. I liked the idea of picking a card for what sort of difficulty you want in the game. It gives the players more control over their deck. That is gone. The mechanics of combat is more of the same from the first. Now the two most frustrating thing about this game is card choice and the dice. I hate the dice rolls. They re not necessary. That s what a success or failure card was for. To continue getting used to the card pick is impossible because you get three shuffles right off the bat at top speed. Enjoy that hope you get the guardian angel blessing ;). The introduction of the camp was a nice idea. It gives you a chance to heal. Visit the shop and change appearance. The only thing I dislike about it is the availability of trade goods. It was exciting to find a shop when you had no food and AS FAR AS I KNOW there are not shop cards. I m going to try and finish this game. This is my first impressions. They are acceptable but I m not blown away. So far I prefer the first. , June 21 2018, While there are improvements in HoF2 there are also frustrations with it,greene,a
Headlander, Striking as hell in the opening sections Headlander s aesthetic is spectacular but a bit vacant and the game itself is a touch repetitive. The script is... alright?

Not awful certainly but only sporadically marvellous and with long boring patches.

Driftmoon, I ve played this game twice and both times had a good time. Its rpg light meaning the genre has been striped down to basic elements you can still craft potions eat food gather loot build your skills etc. its just not super complicated or you have to resort to game manuals in order to figure out how to play. This leaves the game easy to pick up and off you go plenty of flavor text items to manipulate in the landscape lots of loot with clever descriptions in fact you will read a lot in this game and thats where the fun is. The story is perfectly fine along the stereotypical lines of evil baddie taking over the world and a young adventurer set on a path to fight it. many characters with back stories and minor quests. companions to equip. Its like eating potato chips one chip leads to another same with progress in this game. Its hard to put down just one more exploration one more skill to level and before you know it hours have passed. Graphics are minimal but well drawn portraits and dungeons. Music is very well done orchestrated thru out. Menu is easy to use inventory is small enough not to be a hassle. crafting is very quick. Now to the religious stuff. It does have direct references to Christianity but only in a couple of cases. the most egregious is finding a whole bible under a desk. First play thru I was most put out by the proselytizing second play thru I barely noticed. Most of the religious references are what you find in all rpgs referring to a Maker following holy texts and monks path of sanctity. If not for the clumsy insertion of actual bible references you wouldnt even notice. Females are portrayed a bit flaky and girlish which is annoying ive seen worse in other games. Gameplay is maybe 20- 25hrs perfect for a quick fix of rpg goodness it has mods which you can easily access in start menu most are trivial one allows playing as a female which was nice. its addictive and fun , October 7 2018, I ve played this game twice and both times had a good time,merritt,a

Sunrider: Liberation Day - Captain S Edition, Oh boy! What a story! Really good and really locks you on the screen. I only complain is that it is a little confuse. Maybe it was I who didn t pay the deserved attention but But that scene on Diode where things got explained confused me much. But anyway The game sure knows how to make things epic but it is kinda epic all the time. I believe it was because the game was dubbed and that got it more expensive to get it long with good interludes between its epicness and that kinda turn the next epic moments looks really forced kinda diabolus ex machina but it is not enough to mess the enjoyment. I mean each battle looks it will be the last one I think this is fail of design but considering what they wanted to do here it is acceptable. I just think that more things could happen before the liberation day leaving it as the last battle but instead it was battle was broken in segments. About gameplay it has a very large improvement from the past one and I really suggest the devs to fuse both games under the gameplay of Liberation Day because the strategic part feels shallow since the game is shorter and has less battles fusing with the Mask of Arcadius would make things more important but that would require a serious amount of work. hope they do it someday even if they want to launch as a separate game since Mask of Arcadius is free I would buy it jsut don t charge the prize of two full games it won t take that much of work. For the last I think it may be a bug or funds ended before the game but the last part isn t dubbed as the rest. Well anyway the game is really recommended if you want an epic story but as for the strategic part I wouldn t hold my breath you will find better games out there. , June 16 2018, Oh boy!

Risen 2: Dark Waters," It s a great RPG with a very good story lot of sub quest funny henchmen some mini-games... Ok the game has some flaws: - sometimes the frame-rate drops in a scary way (the air temple is almost not playable on my hardware which is very cheap however) - the ground models sometimes makes you get stuck and there s no way out except using the map shortcuts. - too many trees: watching from the edge of a mountain (and jump with the levitation spell of course) was my preferred thing in the previous game. And some drastic changes: - the combat system is strange for who have played Risen 1. - the sensation of magic is gone but it was planned (since in a book you can read that magic had been banned) and replaced with voodoo. - the crafting system is useless worst than Risen 1: you find schemes when you already have the object the cost of crafting is equals to the finihed object the raw materials are quite limited... IN SHORT: If you think to it as a Risen sequel you will be disappointed if considered it as a ""Pirates of the Carribean"" RPG it will become worthy of your time.

Master Of Orion 3, I used to have this game on disc. Bought it at launch. Played &gt;1000 hours of a flawed un-intuitive broken mess. Still loved every minute. With the addition of Strawberry or Tropical mods available on the moo3 site this game is the greatest 4x ever made. The diplomacy system in this game is what Creative Assembly has fever dreams about. With mods its so complex and actually works. Pros: The most complex 4x ever made(Distant Worlds stole so many ideas) Great combat system(When you fully understand the systems combat is bliss and satisfying) Excellent emergent gameplay every game you start(No one game will ever be the same) Unmatched Diplomacy in any game ever(nothing will even come close this was a labor of love) Gog version works right out of the box(needs mods but the steam version isnt even updated) Medium: Learning curve greater than Eve online and most Bachelors Degree courses Takes months almost a year to win some games. Cons: Requires mod to have widescreen support(the age) Completely unforgiving High micromanagement requirement(If you don t like Victoria 2 then don t buy) Like Stellaris some games are unwinnable(unlike stellaris you can win combat outnumbered and you can win most games with pure cunning). Overall: 10/10.

Ascendant, We have something in Ascendant that I find very worthwhile and that I believe you may as well if you are looking for a new kind of roguelite game. You ll may think that Ascendant doesn t have much going for it in the way of mechanical complexity at least initially but when you take the time to learn reflecting casting and juggling enemies; you ll be surprised at how much the combat offers. Boss fights at the end of each dungeon are all particularly compelling as they each have varied approaches to victory. The dungeons are procedurally generated with each game start as each death is permanent and will take away all blessings influence and weapons you have acquired. The game also has a very high level or replayability as completing every dungeon in a single run is very challenging. The art style is colorful and cartoonish but is still one that I enjoy and the game is appropriately priced. What bogs the title down and keeps it from achieving five star status with me is the overly-looping soundtrack questionable hitboxes and the occasional blending of background into foreground interfering with the platforming sections. Those issues aside I still find Ascendant to be an excellent addition to the roguelite genre for bringing a different kind of mechanical complexity to the table. , March 3 2015, We have something in Ascendant that I find very worthwhile and that I believe you may as well if you are looking for a new kind of roguelite game,berg,a
Sublevel Zero Redux," Who makes a game like this where you can t save your progress? Or even if I beat a level I should beat it permanently if you don t want to give me the ability to save. Got past level 0 and 1 did the save and quit. Went back in to play some more. Ran out of time and had to go. When I came back I have to start at level 0 again. So you are gambling your progress every time you play. Speaking of gambling the randomizer is horrible sometimes. Been more than one occasion I just get hulls or engines and no weapons really to speak of. And twice already I have gotten where almost every treasure box was a trap on top of no weapons. Once I got 8 repair kits and sometimes I get 1 or none. You either die from no weapons no ability to get health or sheer lack of energy to power your weapon or you get no ammo for the weapons you are using. I m playing normal difficulty too. The game is over randomizing EVERYTHING you also have to sit and wait while it does this. And with the lack of any ability to save your progress or permanently win an area it just leaves me to believe that there isn t much content. I see 5 levels 4 including 0 and I really think that is it. Considering the length of each level your probably looking at a total span of 2 levels on decent. If you must use a randomizer it is fine to use it for the tunnels and rooms or enemy placement ( keeping a set amount) Or making ""trip wires"" in the code when you come to an area and the randomizer is the decision maker for the enemy. Randomizing as in...holding position leaving and coming for you from behind rushing you and so on. You want the player to feel empowered dying because the enemy was too smart. Dying because the randomizer made you a desert is not fun. Not being able to fire because you are getting ammo for weapons you don t have is not fun. Not being able to save in any way is not fun. It doesn t matter if there isn t much content. For a busy adult to sit and play something ""fresh"" each time with the ability to save their progress. Working toward eventually saving the galaxy would have been a priceless classic and a true ode to descent. Randomizing a little with not many levels is fine. But this seems like the programmer was scared someone would say it s too short because it doesn t have 30+ levels. But as it stands now you are fighting against the randomizer.

Westerado: Double Barreled, Tried this game and found it to be boring slow and aggravating. Some of the gameplay designs are just stupid. Items despawn to quickly fought a group of bandits that dropped five cash sacks and to hats (player lives) but by the time I finished them off everything was gone. Cash can be picked up by walking over it but hats have to be interacted with almost impossible during a intense firefight.

Lords Of Magic: Special Edition, I m sorry but this is one game I can never be won over on. I bought LoM when it first came out and it was at that time and probably still to this day the buggiest mess in computer gaming history. Bitter about that--all games were forty or fifty bucks a shot back then and came only from brick and mortar stores--I waited and waited for it to be patched attempting to wring some enjoyment out of it along the way. I failed miserably at the latter even after eventually much much later achieving the former. This game has just always and in every way for me sucked--and I really really wanted to like i believe me. I gave it every chance but even the music which I can still hear clearly in my head to this day (some might say that s a sign of its greatness but not me) depresses me beyond any ability of mine to convey. It s not that the music is technically bad or anything it s just repulsive--it casts an ultra-dreary pall over the whole experience that makes you feel like slitting your wrists would bring more joy than playing for one more second. And the graphics? Well if this tells you anything: the first time I fired it up back in 1998 I was knocked back on my heels by how bad the graphics were. No other game I can recall made me feel that way and I assure you I bought and played plenty of them back then. Everything in LoM is just a muddy ugly stew of competing colors... And the animations for the rts combat portion of the game? Lol. Just lol. Of course the AI wasn t/isn t good enough for them to really matter so it can be kind of amusing watching your creatures wander around semi-aimlessly like dueling chunks of meat in a boiling stewpot when they should be defending your magical interests with some seriousness of purpose. Now maybe you shouldn t listen to me. Maybe I m exaggerating too much. Others after all claim to like and even love this game. I don t care. I hate it with a passion and my opinion was not come by cheaply. So I say if you re looking for a good fun joyous time do a textbook 180 at this game and run as fast as you possibly can until you hit something--anything--else. , June 22 2018, I m sorry but this is one game I can never be won over on,barr,a

Shardlight, I was coming into this game a little jaded after playing some other adventure games from other publishers that weren t so enjoyable but this one restored my faith that there are good adventure games still out there. I wasn t too crazy about the low resolution graphics but the background art and characters are wonderful. I really hope this game gets remastered someday to higher resolution graphics so that the already high-quality backgrounds and characters can be more fully appreciated. But what truly kept me playing the game was the story and game play. It was very interesting and didn t stay on one thing before moving the plot along. Problems/puzzles weren t very difficult to figure out either.

Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, Note to Prospective Buyers: The game can be finnicky to run on modern systems. If you have issues look up tools like dgVoodoo. Some minor freezes will occur especially when moving to new environments but it is not too bad. Review: Yes an in-game map would be really helpful. Yep enemies will repeatedly 1 shot you so quickly that not even blindly firing around a corner will hlep. Oh and yes some fights pretty much require you to cheat or stun lock your foe(s). All that said loved the characters. The world leaves me begging for me. The gunplay between both your mech and human forms is simple but effective. The levels do a good job balancing feeling like a real place and enabling good gameplay (decisions). Hopefully a spiritual successor is made one day until then I am very happy to have picked Shogo up on sale. , November 4 2018, Note to Prospective Buyers: The game can be finnicky to run on modern systems,griffith,a
Banished," Ich w??rde gerne wissen ob all diese Leute die so ??berschwenglich 5 Sterne vergeben dieses Spiel auch wirklich gespielt haben (gilt bei GOG f??r viele Spiele) und wenn ja wie lange denn der erste Eindruck ist hervorragend spielbar scheint das Ding jedenfalls nicht zu sein.

Daf??r w??re ein ""schlankes"" Spiel wie Banished eigentlich hervorragend geeignet. Was wirklich nervt ist die KI die die Einwohner als Vollidioten agieren l??sst.

Arbeiter die aus irgend einem Grund ihre Arbeit nicht verrichten k??nnen suchen sich irgend eine andere (vorgeblich sinnvolle) Besch??ftigung. Klingt ja clever f??hrt aber dazu dass meine Bauarbeiter behindert durch den Baum eben nicht bauen auch nicht den Baum f??llen nein sie gehen in den Wald und machen dort Holz. Es ist meist schwierig herauszufinden warum die Typen nicht das tun was man erwartet und das Spiel gibt keine Info geschweige denn eine Warnung. Man hat leider keine Zeit sich um diese Dinge zu k??mmern weil man - und das ist der wahre Grund warum ich das Spiel f??r nicht gelungen halte - einen verdammt schmalen Weg beschreiten muss und das noch im richtigen Timing um zu bestehen.

King Of Dragon Pass," I like the idea that quests are unpredictable and despite the best preparation they can fail wiping out some of your best characters. But if you invest the time prepping for them by learning the lore assigning quest points and hoarding magic should you really fail 4 times in a row? At some point you get sick of it especially when you have to guesstimate your chances of success since there s nothing to reference. As you might imagine it takes forever to learn the mechanics of this game. The tutorial is pretty broad and it s a niche game so even if you google how to do this or that you can come up empty handed. If you enjoy learning the ropes by trial and error mixed with a healthy dose of cross referencing google then this might be for you. But then as far as I can tell even you do things ""right"" you have a substantial chance of failing. Finally as other people have said the writing is pretty uninspiring. It s true that you have million different decisions to make but the way that the game gets away with giving you all that freedom is by making the outcomes of those choices relatively meaningless. You will probably get a few follow up events each requiring all of one click but story doesn t change. You just end up with slightly more or less men/resources. Meh.

Bloodrayne, Even though Bloodrayne has some annoying problems and the combat is rather chaotic you just can t help but to feel that juvenile glee while ripping nazis to pieces and watching half-naked vampire chicks with jiggly boobies kicking the living crap out of each other. Those design choices are the sole reason why this game transcended its own mediocrity and became a cult classic. I m also pretty sure that it produced a whole generation of men who had to cope with very confusing boners during their puberty. Unfortunately the game is really dragged down by a ridiculous spike in difficulty during the final act even on easy mode. The vampire enemies are able to take away a full bar of health in less than a second if they gang up on you and it s BS cuz all they seem to do is awkwardly rub against you like its a glitch. Speaking of glitches there aren t that many but they are just infuriating. They can even prevent you from finishing a level unless you cheat. I don t remember those from back in the day so my guess is that the game just spazzes out on modern systems. Finally the saving system is garbage because it allows you to save only during level transitions and some of the levels are pretty long full of difficult fights and cheap ways of killing you right near the exit. You d be hard pressed not to put your fist through the monitor during those moments. , October 11 2018, Even though Bloodrayne has some annoying problems and the combat is rather chaotic you just can t help but to feel that juvenile glee while ripping nazis to pieces and watching half-naked vampire chicks with jiggly boobies kicking the living crap out of each other,norman8511,a

Space Rogue Classic, Unlike the newer game that ripped off the name from this classic. This is the REAL Space Rogue which bears absolutely no resemblence to the newer game. This is a classic and fairly unique style of game. It mixes 3D and 2D game play and does a really nice job of it. You start out on a salvage ship when you discover a small ship drifting in space. While exploring it and salvaging it the ship you started on is attacked and destroyed leaving you the lone survivor on this rogue ship. That s all you know. Why were you attacked? Why was this little ship you now command derelect in space is something you will have to discover. The answers are out there. When flying through space it s all 3D with a 2D map of the sector you are in. You travel between sectors each one unique with various space stations and enemies you encounter. When you dock at a Space Station you switch to a 2D view and interact with people in the station talk to them and gradually put together a story about what is going on. You can also buy and sell upgrades for your ship which starts out fairly weak but over the course of the game you can build it up so it eventually can take out anything that is foolish enough to take you on. But early on you will have to pick your battles carefully if at all. Other items you can purchase are trade goods which you can buy and sell at various prices in different sectors. Some legitimate trades some illegal but worth more... with the right papers. You will need to have a pad of paper on hand and take notes on prices eventually you will discover some lucrative trade routes and upgrade your ship take on side quests and piece together a story that ultimately will answer the question about where the ship you pilot came from among other things. It s a great game and requires a little patience at first but there s a large galaxy to explore with some interesting stories and locations. Well worth the price. , February 15 2018, Unlike the newer game that ripped off the name from this classic,cochran5702,a

Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove, I have been playing Shovel Knight a lot lately. I think I played over 400 hours and I love it. It is my favourite game already and I consider it to be the ultimate platformer. It has a bunch of campaigns that play super different from eachother. The heroes a cool the narrative is sweet but light enough the aestethics suit me perfectly - each and every sprite feel like it has soul on their own. The mechanics which are arguably the most important thing in a platformer are pinpoint accurate. Even the water level is damn fun...it may as well be one of my most favourite in the game. But to be honest I do not see how I will get tired of this game. Even after so much playing I still can boot the game and go beat a campaign pretty much every day. If you have never played a platformer - pick up Shovel Knight! If you do not like platformers - pick up Shovel Knight you may as well be surprised! If you like platformers - I guess you have already picked up Shovel Knight anyway...

Agatha Christie - The Abc Murders," I love seing Agatha Christie s work made into games. As a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes series (yes they too have their weaknesses) and some older Hercule Poirot games I was convinced this game was for me. While I personally have no quarrels with the style it is done in I must say that the writing is mediocre to terrible. There were times where I just couldn t believe the clumsy dialogues and the nonsense that the characters let off. I didn t expect great graphics and I certainly don t need them in a game like this but the writing is essential! ...In this case it s quite disappointing. Aditionally the ""riddles"" are very easy (I would say too easy but that may be different for other people) and the game will hold your hands at all times. This is not to say that that is entirely bad at least you know when you ve found all the clues but I do like a little more freedom to investigate stuff my way. I don t regret having bought the game for 2.50 and having played it through. But I certainly won t recommend it. ", August 16 2018, I love seing Agatha Christie s work made into games,spence6324,a
Okhlos: Omega, The idea behind Okhlos is great: take the command of a furious mob and fight your way through ancient Greece to take down Gods of Olympus. All that action in a very funny way with its share of destruction onomatopoeia and colorful graphics. However I felt rather quickly without any challenge or strategies to think about. The first clues of this lack of depth are controls. You can move directly your leader with the keyboard and order the mod to move/attack/defend a specific location with the mouse. You can also run or regroup your plebs. It s nearly a copy and paste of Pikmin.... depth in less because you can t sort your mob. Of course you can check the forming of the mob or trade new units/plebs with some traders. But again the fact that you need to run over new units on the field makes team management ultra-limited and disappointing. Sorting the mob would have been great too especially for strategies or difficulty because Okhlos has not much ways to win especially with items that you can pick up and gives too powerful bonuses. 4 items in total the powder keg deals damages directly the shield gives a temporary invincibility the meat regenerate all health point and the helm gives a bonus to moral. So even if you encounter enemies that deals damages with areas of effect (which are the nemesis of your mob) you can totally negate these effects by only guarding or using items at the appropriate time. Also the more units you have the better. As an example I could gather more than 10 items in total and I could have been able to hold my 50 units invincible during a whole boss fight... Compared to a game like Pikmin where enemies can split your units trap them change their attributes or even transform the terrain... Okhlos is far more limited even if it s a totally assumed action game. To conclude: I was a bit disappointed. Especially when I ve beaten the last boss after my 3 first hours and with not many efforts. Secrets to find are still a good addition. , August 20 2016, The idea behind Okhlos is great: take the command of a furious mob and fight your way through ancient Greece to take down Gods of Olympus,pate,a
Outcast - Second Contact," If you liked the original you will love this one too - it s (more of) the same with almost every good and bad aspect. There is a bit of auto-targeting added excellent UI updates etc; things that show that the makers understand and love the original you will be pleased. If you never heard of it you might want to skip this one; I m sorry. This game was created with the specific intention to imitate the original in almost every way and I fear that will render it unbearable for people who grew accustomed to the modern times. The controls will feel counter-intuitive even frustrating at times the story and the characters will feel strange and silly - like when you want to talk to anyone for example a village elder and your avatar just walks up to him and say ""Yo come here for a sec"" or something detached like that. Also this game DOES NOT hold your hand you ll get an intro mission that supposedly teaches you five basic things and then off you go... figure it out Pal! The neutral aspects include a robust vocabulary of the Talan people the game includes a lexicon where it stores the definitions of the things you ask in conversations with others - you ll be building your dictionary throughout the gameplay. The final goal of the game is to overthrow the government which you can do by systematically disrupt and dismantle their military forces by completing quest for locals who in return will eventually do things like stop producing ammo or food for the soldiers things like that contrarily to what I wrote a few line above that this game does not hold your hand it gives you a clear final objective which you can now track in the last page of the inventory.

Messiah, Warning: There will be SPOILERS in this review. As far as game developers go I am kind of sad Shiny Entertainment aren t around anymore. Back when I was young they made some of the most interesting impressive and awe-inspiring PC games of all time. After getting their start with Earthworm Jim the team developed the enormous cult classic MDK which released in 1997 to glowing reviews (and low sales figures). Their games always had a very quirky feel to them and often a dark sense of humor. Today I m going to take a look at a game that to me embodies everything Shiny Entertainment represented back in those days before they fell down into the black hole of developing nothing but movie tie-ins. Ladies gentlemen and everything in between I present to you: Messiah. Bob is a working class angel a cherub who is given a pretty huge task by his father the creator. Earth has become a bit of a cesspool as of late and is in need of some cleaning so he sends Bob down to deal with it. Of course once you re there a few issues present. 1. You re a tiny cherub with no means of defending himself. 2. Society seems to be at war with a race of cannibalistic mutants. 3. A dark figure named Father Prime is trying to open a portal to hell. So things seem to be a bit more challenging than anticipated. But Bob is given a very useful ability. He can possess any living being and use them as a second skin. And that s where Messiah begins and its main gameplay element is introduced. Messiah is a game that can be rather deceiving. On the surface it might look like a third person shooter much akin to Shiny s previous game MDK but the reality is that Messiah is really a puzzle game at heart and approaching it in any other way will make it insanely hard to progress in the game. So the open nature of the game is in of itself deceiving as the puzzles really only have one solution most of the time and it is more than possible to absolutely ruin any progression if you do something wrong so saving often and having multiple saves is a must in this game. The game will often put you in a hub of rooms where you will need to possess various types of humans to progress and may have to kill some people or use stealth to achieve your goal. The game never holds your hand never tells you the solution it will drop hints in the environment but other than that this game is truly more a test of your brain than your reflexes and I hesitate to call it an action game because while it has the elements of one I spent most of my time in this game just trying to figure out how to proceed. In that sense I would more call it an adventure game in the guise of an action game. The game also rather insidiously messes with your expectations of what it might be. It puts you in control of an angel a baby even who looks rather innocent but requires you to do a lot of horrible things during the game creating a very strong contrast with its diaper-clad hero and its themes. During the latter part of the game you re even required to infiltrate a night club in a red light district filled with drug addicts and prostitutes and strippers. The game is definitely not what I would call child friendly but it does have a lot of things I think more mature gamers would enjoy. Messiah is a game that surprisingly doesn t take itself too seriously. Sure it creates a gritty dystopian future where people no longer have a sense of selves but are just workers and cops but at least it has fun with its setting puts humor where it is needed and gives the different human types enough personality to stand out. My favourite moment is when Satan is revealed to be the main villain but his broadcast is broken when his imps who are quite hard to control start messing with his stuff. Moments like these feel very typical of Shiny s style and the mix of humor and a very dark and bleak setting feels like a continued exploration of similar themes from MDK (which I will get more into whenever I review it). The gameplay mostly revolves around the main possession mechanic that is pretty much introduced the moment the game begins. You will need to possess various humans with different jobs/roles to access new places for instance only workers can operate machinery or only commanders can access high security areas. Different human types will also react differently to seeing you depossessed. Cops will shoot at Bob if he s not in disguise and will continue to do so if they see him possessing someone. Scientists workers and other non-aggressive human types will leave him alone though and mostly just act with curiousity. The game puts a lot of attention to details like these which helps a lot in just making the world feel like it s real and developed. It s not exactly Deus Ex levels which I find a bit disappointing I would certainly have loved if Messiah had some RPG elements where you could talk to people while possessing certain humans. I feel there s a lot of unexplored potential here so this game could really benefit from a modern remake in my opinion. Despite the somewhat unexplored potential in the game the game does feel pretty deep for a game of its time. Like I said it s not exactly Deus Ex levels but compared to Shiny s previous game MDK it s a huge step up and a rather different game in tone from that game. But what it does have in common with MDK is probably the enormous variety in gameplay elements. There are moments where you need to shoot everything in sight moments where you need to be stealthy and levels that are so straight forward you re pretty much just looking for the way forward. The game s early levels surprisingly proved the most difficult for me. The latter part of the game is actually fairly easy and straight forward and by then you will be fairly attuned to Bob s abilities and the various human types of the game and their roles in society. Story and hints are usually relayed to you through regular messages given to you when your head is ringing first presumably from God and then later from Satan. The game s environments consist almost entirely of urban landscapes exploring various complexes and buildings set to the backdrop of a dystopian city with some architecture (possibly intentionally) reminiscent of the buildings we saw in their earlier game MDK. The first part of the game largely explores a major human city where there s a bit of a war going on between the upper class of people and a race of mutated cannibalistic humanoids called Chots. This conflict dominates large parts of the early game but is never revisited once you ve beaten Father Prime (which only happens in a cutscene kinda sad they never developed a full boss fight there...) which leaves it feeling somewhat unresolved. It quickly becomes obvious though that a lot of the mutants you meet in the game ranging from Chots to Behemoths are really just results of Father Prime s experiments so it makes sense that once you ve beaten him they become less of an issue. Later on it becomes a bit unclear whether Behemoths are considered enemies or allies of the cops in the game given that you d usually find them in highly secured areas typically locked up and if you possess them and walk around cops will usually just ignore you but they will still fire at you. I guess it could imply that they know something is wrong when a Behemoth is loose but still... it was a bit confusing. The latter part of the game sends you into a place called Sex City where your goal is to infiltrate a night club called Club Kyd (very likely named after Jesper Kyd who made parts of the game s soundtrack). Somehow from there you make your way into a millitary installation and to the Earth s moon where Satan is waiting for you. It doesn t make a whole lot of sense probably cause it shouldn t but the absurdity of this happening just kinda feels right in this future dystopian city you re in. Combat in Messiah is actually pretty straight forward and at times required to progress in the game. The game will use an auto-targeting system where you aim in someone s general direction and a reticle will appear on them to signify you are locked in on them. The targeting also works likewise for enemies and if an enemy is locked in on you you will see a similar reticle appear on your body to signify where you are being shot from. I noticed some issues getting a lock on enemies that were too far away in some parts though this is rarely an issue due to the scarcity of the battles. The main challenge comes from how you manage your resources in a level and which of the humans you should get rid of and which you should keep and use given how the different groups will interact and how people will react to seeing you outside a body. The weapons in the game are pretty varied. You ll mostly see the shotgun which seems to be standard issue for most cops but there s also machine pistols (typically carried by Commanders but also some heavy cops). There s also a flamethrower in there because... why not. One of the more notable weapons later in the game is the Maser a plasma weapon distinctly designed to combat Behemoths who carry pretty bulky armor but is practically useless against humans (though it does a good job knocking them down for a few secs). Just like people the weapons are treated more like tools in this game and the Maser comes into play during a section where you re tasked with getting through a bunch of Behemoths. Using the Maser makes this a very easy task but attempting it without it even by possessing one of the Behemoths makes it a suicide mission. The controls can take a bit of getting used to. I would recommend mapping the game to use a more appropriate WASD setup just keep in mind that the game might feel a bit weird at first since moving the mouse also moves your character s direction. There is a freelook button but it s not possible to move while holding it and it s not possible to move around in first person either (unless you re possessing a rat or crawling through a duct) which would ve been neat. During platforming sections I noticed that Bob s flying mechanic takes some getting used to as I died a lot not being able to reach other platforms. Keep in mind that in order to fly you have to rapidly tap the jump button not holding it down or tapping it slowly like I assumed. Graphically the game looks absolutely amazing for its time. On modern system the legacy support is kind of terrible though and sometimes models will glitch out and warp a bit at certain angles but the environments are absolutely gorgeous and the game has a very distinct dystopian cyberpunk atmosphere that is so thick you can slice it. The costumes for the various models also makes it very clear what type of human they are. Cops are dressed in protective gear radiation workers wear radiation suits scientists have... scientist apparel Chots are dressed in body suits with gas masks workers wear overalls and wield welders and welding goggles and strippers prostitutes and such are very obviously of that profession. The amount of variety in the game is surprising at times especially in sex city where there are at least 2-3 unique prostitutes/dancers and you ll sometimes come across female cops and cops with riot shields. I can t really find much to complain about with the graphics for the time this game was state of the art and as a I recall even shipped with some graphics card at the time. The game also has amazing sound. The soundtrack which was made by Tommy Tallarico Studios Jesper Kyd and others is mostly ambience and while in most games I am not a huge fan of this style here it makes total sense as it builds up the atmosphere in the world you re in and since most of the game is spend just exploring using your brain and figuring out how to work the world around you a less intrusive soundtrack is actually welcome. There s also a lot of great voice acting with Bob seemingly voiced by a toddler (who does a pretty good job) and all of the humans will say little things now and then often somewhat humorously. During combat there s some heavy industrial metal playing by the band Fear Factory which fits those situations as it really gets your adrenaline going. There is an option for disabling Fear Factory s music during combat but I highly suggest leaving it on as it adds a lot of welcome diversity to the game s soundtrack. As a note it seems the GOG version of the game has some Spanish speech on the included soundtrack which is at times really distracting and pops up seemingly at random. I tried googling this but found no other mention of it so either there is no fix for it or people just don t care. It s not a major issue and I haven t tested the Steam release for it but something to be aware of. All in all Messiah is a really quirky really fun and really REALLY challenging game due to how it constantly catches you off guard. But you ll not likely ever play anything like it again and despite its flaws I highly recommend playing it at least once. Getting it running on modern systems can be a bit of a hassle but I think it s worth it. It offers a massive world to explore absolutely unique gameplay both for its time and even today and if you love other Shiny games like MDK Sacrifice and Giants: Citizen Kabuto then you owe it to yourself to play it.

Jazzpunk: Flavour Nexus," Flavour Nexus is little disappointment for me. Jazzpunk always was criticized for as short as good. Unfortunately Flavour Nexus doesn t cure it. This is just one levelmap in this addon all about shopping in big store. You re task is simple - go buy smelling salt. As usual in Jazzpunk you can just go and do that and miss like 95% of whole gameplay. If you want to spend a little more time shopping you can browse shelfs do some random stuff and so on. Not really much to do anyway. Once you done you presented with nice Carmageddon-style Monster-truck Fight with Psycho (remember this one from Japanese level wrestling arena?) in which you can crush literally everything and...thats all. Almost. All that left to you is strange futuristic ""MadMax-like"" chase with no reason (more like scraped idea leftovers) and credit roll. Its not really that bad there is some interesting jokes its worth to look monster-truck fight is brilliant idea but overall its dont even close to original game not in amount of stuff not in humor. But still i d like to see more. ", November 24 2017, Flavour Nexus is little disappointment for me,farrell2137,a
A Golden Wake, As I liked other Wadjet Eye Games a lot I bought this one without reading reviews etc. For me this game sadly lacks on the puzzles level (too easy / simple - even if I didn t know what to do there where only two or three things to do or click anyway) and on the story level (fragmented story / episodes; the game gave me no real motivation why I should do something and what s the bigger plan or purpose for what I m doing). So I can t recommend this one to adventure fans. , January 20 2018, As I liked other Wadjet Eye Games a lot I bought this one without reading reviews etc,robbins857,a
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back, Bubsy is back at the request of nobody; developed by the same team as Gianna Sisters: Twisted Dreams Bubsy is at least competent in that it runs fine and doesn t control too awfully. That s about all the positives you can give it though; the game is incredibly short still far too expensive for what it is incredibly easy and every level is pretty much the same. You get some new enemies and obstacles but there are no extra powers and each level is still just running from left to right across bog-standard platforms. The worst crime though is that it s as dull a game as you can get. , September 28 2018, Bubsy is back at the request of nobody; developed by the same team as Gianna Sisters: Twisted Dreams Bubsy is at least competent in that it runs fine and doesn t control too awfully,hendrix8282,a
Carmageddon: Max Damage, It s great! They ve improved the handling for the cars. It s challenging fun and fast-paced. You can even run over Trump and Hillary so what s not to like? Well... The only real problem I have with it is that they said they d work on a Linux version. This never happened. A lot of us backed the Kickstarter because of this. You know with all the advancements in Linux gaming as of late (I m playing Mad Max Killing Floor 2 and even No Man s Sky on Linux) I d be perfectly satisfied if they d release a patch for this game that makes it compatible with Wine or Proton. , November 3 2018, It s great!

Anachronox, I have played a LOT of games since I discovered my first game in 1980 - a text only game called Adventure. I played Anachronox when it was first released and it is one of the few that sticks out in my memory - a great memory with some of the best humor and wonderful characters I ve ever seen in games. I am SO happy that GOG released this game to run on modern systems. My only complaint from before was the padding during scene transitions and battles but with the addition of the key to speed up the padding I now have NO complaints - this is one of the best games I ve had the pleasure to play and even the outdated graphics have a certain charm - this game still manages to convey character expressions and emotions - the important things. For those who have never played Anachronox I heartedly recommend it - you will NOT regret playing it. And for those who played it when it was first released I still heartedly recommend it for your enjoyment will not be any less - at least that is what I m experiencing as I relive my youth during my play. , May 10 2018, I have played a LOT of games since I discovered my first game in 1980 - a text only game called Adventure,ramsey1152,a

Braveland Wizard, This is going to be much like my review for the original Braveland. This game is a fun turn-based hexagonal board game in the mold of Heroes of Might and Magic with a map progression in the Mario level selection screen realm. There s no real story and the game is pretty straight forward and linear. Only three times do you get to choose something different the first two you either chose left or right at a fork in the road that leads you to the same path and the third is how you want the end of the story to read. There s also a quiz after the second to last battle with 3 questions that will reward you with a prize if you answer all 3 correctly. There are no second chances if you fail. So pay attention during the game. There are 3 difficulty settings. You get to level up your hero (that never fights) but that increases the potential size of the armies you control. You can acquire 4 types of gear that benefits your armies. You have to spend money to recruit most of your army. Money is obtained mostly by defeating the enemy and minimizing your losses during combat. THERE IS MUCH LESS MONEY PER COMBAT THAN THE LAST GAME. So there s more of a grind. There are 3 separate respawning points that you can grind out on to get more gold. There s about 35-40 different enemies (some from the original) that you can run into and they each have their strengths and weaknesses that blend together with other enemies. Almost every unit you have gets a special ability at some point. This game also introduces talent/spell trees to give a little more flavor of what strategy you want to take. It s a lot more interesting than the last game but the game still only takes about 3-5 hours. It s worth it if you get it on sale but I wouldn t pay the full asking price for a game that you can beat after you get home from work and before you go to bed. , March 14 2017, This is going to be much like my review for the original Braveland,hardin,a

Mary Skelter: Nightmares, Average gameplay somewhat bad graphics and a story that doesn t properly use the material it s based on. Still a good enough game to make me play it to the end. Graphics: The 3D dungeons have varied clearly defined themes and the enemies try be quite grotesque but the graphics fail to properly express this. 2D art is good though. Sound: Pretty average nothing really stood out either way. Story: Main story was surprisingly harmless (was expecting a more dark ending) but it used very little of the material the characters are based on (Hansel and Gretel Little Red Riding Hood Snow White etc.) which at least for me was a bit of a disappointment. I still recommend the game to those that don t hate anime turn based games somewhat shallow but it probably delivered enough to be worth it s price. , August 18 2018, Average gameplay somewhat bad graphics and a story that doesn t properly use the material it s based on,vincent,a
X Rebirth, If the recent updates have made this game better as other reviews say then the original release must have been really terrible. The highway system is weird and glitchy. The controls are cumbersome and seem designed only for controllers. The first time I went to dock with another ship 15 minutes into the campaign the auto-dock got the Skunk stuck bouncing up and down inside the cargo bay and I had to exit the game. If you liked previous X games this one will be a disappointment. Walking around in stations is not at all fun it s repetitive and immediately tedious. Being limited to one ship makes the world feel a lot smaller too. While the X games have always had charmingly bad writing it was okay because there was more to do in the game. Here they ve added more dialogue and story than usual but it falls flat because the simplistic plot and cardboard characters just stand out a lot more. The initial companion character in particular is a cringeworthy bundle of tired tropes. I went back and played X3:AP to make sure I wasn t misremembering things but that is definitely a much more enjoyable game than this one warts and all. , August 19 2018, If the recent updates have made this game better as other reviews say then the original release must have been really terrible,romero7157,a

Secret Agent, Whenever I need a break from huge sprawling games that are the norm nowadays with triple-A studios I find myself going back to a couple of DOS games time and again including this and Crystal Caves which follows a similar gameplay style. There s no deep mechanic here it s simply clearing out levels through 2D platforming challenges. There isn t even a boss here but the game is still satisfying to play even today. The good: - platforming and controls are solid - levels seem simple yet present a good challenge - no real replayability value but still fun to go through again and again The bad: - 2D sprites are on the rougher end of the scale (not the developer s fault mind this is fairly good art when it came out originally) I m fine with the art but may not be to othersliking - no background music and simple SFX (again more of a function of the time it was made originally) The ugly: - nah there s nothing overly bad about this game Verdict: At $5.99 really you can t go wrong with this if 2D platforming is your cup of tea. This is an underrated classic. , August 13 2018, Whenever I need a break from huge sprawling games that are the norm nowadays with triple-A studios I find myself going back to a couple of DOS games time and again including this and Crystal Caves which follows a similar gameplay style,alvarez1260,a

Candle, I bought this game because I liked artistic styles genre puzzles and story. All of them seem to be very interesting??? and they are. Nevertheless when I tried to play it I found a lot of issues which might to be fixed in a future but completely stopped me to play this game in early stages. I ll list issues I encountered and possible ways to fix them. I hope developers will roll out the update with fixes as they are crucial for many players as I ve saw walkthroughs and reviews afterwards. Steam version has the same issues and some of them fixed by steam midlayer (a controller issue). * Controller buttons are not processed correctly (long B). I have to use keyboard with a pretty wierd mapping layout and inability to remap keys It could be fixed by more testing and giving a user ability to remap layout without Steam API. * I can t run from the standing state. Other games allow this and in this game I have to remember it constantly which is not a good idea. Probably this is a correct way to handle it but there s too many short platforms and you ll die or repeat jumping to the same platform just because of this issue. It s frustrating. * Edge borders of surfaces are too exact to handle jumping easily. It s not a bad idea to be exact with edges and you ll see it on many platformers as well. The difference is on other platformers /visual/ edges are the same as real edges. When you jump to the edge you know if you land the surface or not. In this game you never sure about this. Every single edge is different and you have to memorize them. This also leads to misjumps and unobvious positions. it s very frustrating. * Unobvious ressurection positions on death. I didn t know where checkpoints are I have to save often to be sure where and on which state I ll be resurrected. it s mega-frustrating. I hope developers will refine this game and players will enjoy their playthrough.

Men Of War: Vietnam, Buenocreo que ademas de mi primera review es la primera en espanol de entre tantos juegos y analisis vistosen fin al loro. Cuando se anuncio por primera vez hubo mucha expectacion por la tematica de Vietnam que se empezo a diluir nada mas enterarse que no podrias controlar los clasicos Huey por desgracia el juego carece de todo lo que hace grance a Men of War aqui van algunas cositas. Falta de armasvehiculos y otras clasicas cosas del conflicto vietnamita que daria para hacer una enciclopedia si mencionara todo lo que podrian haber incluido y para colmo reciclando material de anteriores juegos de Men of Waren serio camiones y jeeps de la segunda guerra mundial ni siquiera se tomaron la molestia de googlear el tipo de vehiculos de la logistica y suministros de la epoca para saber que en vietnam ni de cona existian viejos camiones zil o zis de la segunda guerra mundial. Despues de jugar anteriores titulos y ver la biblia en forma de material historico de la segunda guerra mundial que venia en cada titulo esto es poco mas que un insulto. Pero espera lo mejor esta por llegarsolo hay un total de 10 misiones unicas distribuidas entre los dos bandos y reciclado de escenarios que llaman cinicamente misiones bonus las campanas salvo un grupo selecto de misiones son pesimas en su mayoria y desaprovechando los personajes. No hay batallas masivas o operaciones basadas en hechos reales no hay ataques con napal o bombardeos masivos no hay variedad de unidadesarmas artilleria vehiculos etc. Ni merece ser llamado expancion o mod de Men of War viendo lo que hace la comunidad o la expancion Red Tide esto es poco mas que un insulto.

Bloodnet, I want to like this game but the user interface is a pain to figure out. You *need* the manual and even then it s painful. Moving the mouse is annoying. Figuring out what keys to press is annoying. The spoken dialogue is low-res and has no subtitles. For my part I gave up after an hour or so. If I had more patience in figuring all of this out I might enjoy this game but right now I m just too old for this and I have better things to do than spend hours figuring out how to play a game. , November 2 2018, I want to like this game but the user interface is a pain to figure out,holman,a

Hotline Miami, I remember playing through this game a couple of years ago and back then I found it frustrating at times. Now I was able to blast through it in one sitting. The length of the game depends on one s skill. The soundtrack is pretty much perfect. It seems that my biggest problems with this game weren t as severe as I remember them being back in the day and I m going to list them here: - RNG (biggest problem of this game even speedrunners need luck at certain points in the game as certain starting configurations are near impossible and it s impossible to pull off certain stats consistently) - inconsistent behavior of enemies (at times it s possible to shoot weapons next to them and have them not notice it) - cutscenes that can t be skipped (especially ones before boss fights) - no way to restart the current floor without dying - stealth level (a really big mistake that s not fun at all just like hotline miami 2) - certain levels are so big they require guessing what s happening on the opposite site of the map - masks aren t unlocked by default (I didn t like having to unlock Tony again) Inconsistency and RNG are possibly the most frustrating aspect of this game as they shift difficulty of the game towards luck which should not be involved here at all. The GNU/Linux port seems to work well although only a 32-bit binary is available so mutilib is required and it depends on obscure libraries such as nvidia-cg-toolkit which required searching for by names as it s not possible to simply guess their package names. , October 20 2018, I remember playing through this game a couple of years ago and back then I found it frustrating at times,mays,a

Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, I played IWD several times I still have the original with CDs manual and box. It runs on Windows 7 not very well but it runs. There are mods which help to use the old game but the Enhanced Version makes this unnecessary. The game in itself is quite linear with a gripping but fairly simple story both expansions (Heart of Winter and the free expansion Trials of the Luremaster) are included and integrated well. You can play every of the three items alone or all three in one pass with the same party. Less interesting for me is the multiplayer mode so I cannot say anything about that. But you need the multiplayer mode if you want to change your party in mid game. (Instructions how to do this are on the Beamdog forums). There is a new quest (which was cut from the original game) and this quest is really nice and works flawlessly as the entire game does. Also there are small things like a shield which can be significantly upgrade by talking to a NPC which really surprised me. XP values are higher in certain places which leads to a very high level party. Spells (which always were missing in the original game) were added but no High Level Abilities. In the original game toward the end of the game you could have a mage - without 9th level spells. This is now much better in the Enhanced Version. I recommend a party with multiclass characters (dual class could be done but is very hard). Multiclass characters reach high levels too are more versatile and more fun because after level 25 characters do not really improve any more in AD&amp;D. My party is in the Trials after doing most of the main game and a good part of Heart of Winter and they are around level 25 (Mage Fighter) and over 30 for the Cleric.

Deathtrap Dungeon, Although I m glad to have this game in my collection for personal / nostalgic reasons trying to relive the experience is painstaking and serves as nothing more than a bad relic of the past. The auto-rotating camera views tank controls and poor aesthetic (doors pretty much look like walls etc) makes for a pretty terrible experience all around. The gravity-defying jumping mechanic also seems a bit misplaced as it s far too easy to overshoot or undershoot a leap of faith which usually results in another death. Still for nostalgic reasons I love to pull this out and wonder what the devs at the time were even thinking with some of the aforementioned design flaws considered. It almost seems as if they were purposely trying to make an impossibly terrible game and no amount of control scheme shifting can rectify it. , March 5 2018, Although I m glad to have this game in my collection for personal / nostalgic reasons trying to relive the experience is painstaking and serves as nothing more than a bad relic of the past,powers2531,a
Knights Of The Sky, I bought Knights of the Sky on release and at the time it was one of my favourites. I remember one morning I decided to play a few missions before school and was so engrossed that I lost track of time and missed attendance. Among the WWI simulators of the time it doesn t have the same level of charm as Wings or the sophisticated flight model of Red Baron but sits comfortably between the two. You re a career pilot for the Allies (no German campaign) and over the course of the war you ll receive several events between missions. New planes will become available or retired on both sides. Maybe an enemy Ace will challenge you to a duel on your next mission providing a secondary objective. Rival squad mates will join your squad achieve promotions or be tragically killed in action. Each campaign plays a little differently. Your squadron may be transferred to a different aerodrome along the front or once you achieve the rank of Captain you may move it yourself. Your areodrome is your spawn point which decides your field of operations. Missions range from patrols bombing enemy bases to eliminating balloons. Beyond that you are free to explore the 3D map so far as your fuel tank will let you. This game taught me to manage my throttle to conserve fuel so that I could visit far off Brussels and return to a friendly airstrip. It also taught me to conserve my ammo and the importance of dive bombing. It was simple to learn but challenged me to become a better gamer. A few years ago I loaded up my original disks and ran it in DosBox. Does the game hold up? Frankly there are simply more modern flight simulators available with improved physics and graphics. Taking off the nostalgia goggles I found the terrain bland and the polygons blocky. It s functional though and as a piece of history KotS is a worthy title that featured one of the first instances of dial-up multiplayer in a flight sim. , July 21 2016, I bought Knights of the Sky on release and at the time it was one of my favourites,levy2109,a
Full Spectrum Warrior," Before I review the title there is a thing I need to mention: on Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit version) and Intel HD 4000 this game has a mildly annoying audio stuttercrackling issue. No amount of tinkering with compatibility settings seems to solve it. I do say it is MILDLY annoying: it is usually only present during dialogues and not so much during the rest of the game. That said the biggest issues are 1. its length: I haven t counted how many hours it takes to finish it but a rough estimate puts the number at about 8-9 hours; 2. the annoying ""sit rep"" thing: the game has no ""saves"" it has sit reps which are locations marked by military insignia of some sort you have to move your squad to. The annoying thing here is you usually command two teams sometimes three and you need to move all of them to that location; and sometimes both teams can be far from each other and there is no button to call all of your teams to a given sit rep location; also consider that each of your squads has to be moved multiple times before it reaches it. Seriously what was the point? A quick save or checkpoint-based system would have been much smoother and less annoying. 2b: each sit rep ends with ""Sit rep saved... Out.""; the original quote is much longer and ""drawn out"". You hear it every time you load a game and there is no way to skip it. What an oversight. 3. You sometimes cannot ""lock onto"" a cover quickly enough with your mouse; it s hard to explain. I don t remember it being such a pain on the Xbox; 4. No controller support. Lame and reeks of being a rushed PC ""port""; 5: you cannot issue an order while another order is already being carried out; you can cancel your current order and issue another one but it would have sped many operations up. 6. literally the worst of them all: when switching from a team to another it takes time for the camera to ""reach"" the selected team: it is not istantaneous. 6b: sometimes very bad camera. Otherwise a solid 78100 game.

Dropsy, Good visuals (i.e. this game has unique distinctive art style) but they can only help shifting the initial sell and I couldn t find anything for me to stay with the game  till completion because you ll end up revolving around a few dozens of screens multiple times to find a missing piece of a puzzle (and you re not sure which puzzle exactly you re trying to solve at any selected moment).

Morphopolis, Very immersive relaxing and satisfying game. Different from other HOGs I ve played. Quite short but worth the price. I loved the very slow pace and the slightly frustrating gameplay. The occasional struggle to move is humbling and calls for respect and consideration of the environment. Audio is wonderful (headphones recommended). Gameplay wise I had to perservere during the first few minutes and then it became second nature. Worst case scenario there is a hint button.

Zafehouse: Diaries," Good: *Survivor interactions are nuanced; they do not automatically all get along. *A large inventory of items that are modifiable. *Ability to add custom characters to the game *It???s a buck 99 It is well worth the price. *Similar to a roguelike Bad: *User interface leaves a lot to be desired it???s not ""ergonomic"" and cumbersome to manage especially the inventory. *The game is not forgiving: automatically triggered AI ""ambushes"" will cut your game short. I.e. The timing and results are artificially unfair since they impose no win situations upon the player. Borderline *Way too easy to become ""infected"" *Gameplay can be a bit repetitive Conclusion: I wish the player was granted a little bit more control over the actions of the characters and situations. For example if you assault a location you cannot call off an attack if you realize you are outnumbered forgot an important item or just plain changed your mind. It seems reasonable that an assault team would reconsider an assault and not charge headlong into disaster if certain conditions exist. The no win ""random"" (inevitable) events are just completely unfair. The results are almost always un-survivable meaning if they occur your game will shortly be over no matter how well you ve managed your game up to that point. The game is punishing and can be frustrating but it can also be fun. I play it not necessarily to win but to see how long I can survive and come close to victory. If you like easy victories surely you will be disappointed in this game. p.s. I have mostly played the Road Kill scenario &amp; not yet played the Deadline scenario p.s.s. It???s a buck 99!

Rogue Legacy, Although it held my interest for eight or so hours It made me want to play a good old Metroidvania without the procedural generation gimmick instead. Procedural generation &amp; the Metroidvania style of games that rely on good well thought out map design just does not mix well. This game will get the job done for a low end game to play when you re waiting for a download in the background or listening to a podcast however it just does not hit the mark for me. There s better out there but kudos for the developers for rolling out a new update after all these years though. It may be small but post launch support without the modern game industry nickel &amp; diming is always a nice thing to see. In short: Not bad not great but passable. If you burned through all other of the Castlevania/Metroid style games out there this may be worth a look. , October 11 2018, Although it held my interest for eight or so hours It made me want to play a good old Metroidvania without the procedural generation gimmick instead,roach2841,a

Mount & Blade: Warband, This is a game that can make you tear your hair out absolutely frustrating and at times downright cruel. So then how can such a game warrant 4 out of 5 stars? It is cunningly addictive in that you are invested in seeing through a goal that you set for yourself. In many ways your experience is a reflection of how effective (or ineffective) your strategy and/or goal is. But invested you shall be as you must define what your goal is and what you want to achieve in what you are playing. This is a game that has all sorts of features that will take well over 100 hours to learn and to even know they exist! This is a game of patience of time. This does not excuse entirely the distractions: strange battle maps with excessive hill height hit boxes that are frustratingly precise as you could be swinging a sword at an enemy s head next to your knee and somehow it does not connect(!) random glitch quests that cancel at will or run counter to each other etc. Yet these distractions do not lose the love of the game but endear it for at its core it is a game for you and determined by you. In a way it is a marvel and a love note that is not known enough. MB&amp;W is packed with more features world-building and astonishingly dovetails several different kinds of games into one. It is at once a role-playing game a tower defense a real time strategy an adventure etc. To be able to pull all these elements together and not have a machine running on fumes is a few unto itself. I ve played Skyrim the Civilization series Xcom Fallout series and other games that only focus on certain elements present in MB&amp;W but none have been able to be as invested as this game is. If you want a real challenge and a love of video games this one will challenge the noggin! , November 4 2018, This is a game that can make you tear your hair out absolutely frustrating and at times downright cruel,mcdonald,a
Agarest: Generations Of War," In a nutshell if you imagine what the JP Sega Saturn game Tactics Ogre might look like if it were remade by the developers of Hyperdimension Neptunia you d have this game. It has some elements that seem bizarre and some that can be frustrating but on the bright side it gives the player a lot of choices in how to build their party grow character stats configure skill lists and so on. If you like micromanagement and customizability it s there but you can also opt-out to a large extent. The battle system is reminiscent of chess where the placement of units is heavily emphasized and it s required to think ahead several moves to ensure that you don t put yourself in a bind. Characters can be revived if they die so there s no need to aim for perfection. While each round has a separate movement and action phase units move around during the action phase as a side effect of linked attacks. This can be taken advantage of in order to avoid enemy attacks expand your own attack range or setup area attacks that can hit multple targets. Enemies can be captured and added to the player s party and rare items may be obtained by stealing them during battle or by doing huge extra damage to defeated enemies. There are also prizes to be earned by meeting other conditions (eg. 50 hits in a combo dealing 10k damage defeating 10 of a certain enemy etc.). These things aren t required to advance the game. The game has several difficulty levels and when I purchased this on GOG it included the extra areas and loot from the ""DLC."" When beginning a new game it s possible to choose which extra loot you want. Some of it will make you insanely powerful for the early part of the game (hence I declined nearly all of it when I played) but it s a crutch that can be leaned on for those who are staunchly opposed to grinding.

Cornerstone: The Song Of Tyrim, Although obviously going for a Windwaker-vibe the game does not in fact deliver anything close to it. Crafting is a necessary and boring part of the game (you have to scroll through a list and hold a button to build something). Combat is also boring and lacks any feeling like the rest of the game it feels a bit  floaty . The physics engine the game uses shares the same feeling/issue which makes everything including moving around just feel slightly dull and annoying. The world is extremely minimalistic and small. There aren t many different enemies and not many enemies in general. And the boss battles are unimaginative and occasionally consist of very slowly chipping away at a huge lifebar. This is made even more fun by the fact that your weapons break and you have to craft replacements. Controlling the game with a controller is possible but you do need to move a cursor over objects to interact with them so M+KB might be an easier way to play. Having to move the camera around to pick up a small sword in the middle of a battle is not a lot of fun. Like WindWaker you ll have to travel between islands which in this game is once again not a lot of fun. The distances between the islands have been filled with debris which slows you down and poison mines that slowly kill you. That combined with the fact that your boat doesn t stay on course means you can t just point your boat in the right direction and let go. They probably realised this themselves which is why you can fast travel to an island after having visited it once. There is also a loading freeze when the game moves you from the world map to the island instance (on SSD). All in all it s not a terrible game.. but it is pretty empty dull and not particularly well-made. It s almost like a demo for an engine. , September 29 2016, Although obviously going for a Windwaker-vibe the game does not in fact deliver anything close to it,farrell1385,a
The Raven Remastered," I m no big fan of point&amp;click adventures but from time to time a good title will hold my interest long enough to finish it. The Raven Remastered is such a title. I really liked the first part of the game: the setting is nice the atmosphere is right the art style and voice acting is good. The story is interesting and the puzzles are maybe not the best but quite fitting. The notebook with the optional hints is a neat idea but it would have been nice to know in advance that using the hints will lower your score. The possibility to highlight all ""hotspots"" on the screen can be helpful for beginners but the highlighting could be a litte bit more noticeable. POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWING In the second part of the game you will replay some scenes from the first part but from another perspective. It is really interesting because you get answers to questions which may have came up in the first part. The puzzles are not really good here: often you simply combine everything with everything to progress and will shake your head because of the ""solutions"" (yeah I really must find a drain to bend some piece of wire because how could bend a piece of wire otherwise?). As interesting the notebook is with its descriptions of characters and events it becomes confusing later on because you do not get a notification about which parts have been updated. Because of that I barely read the notebook in the second half. The end was really surprising and I could not have guessed it but it could have been handled better (maybe dropping the faintest of hints around the game to get you thinking). I do not have a reference for how long a good point&amp;click adeventure should last but it took me nearly twelve hours to finish it. Fortunately the first part took more than half of the time. I would advise anyone interested in the game to wait for a sale: it may not be worth full price.

Terraria," Many others have gushed over how long they ve spent in the game so I ll post actual reasons why you should buy it. There s a breadth of variety you don t see in other sandbox games - you aren t stuck progressing from items A to B to C. In each tier alone you have numerous choices that suit different playstyles. Prefer melee and want to wield badass swords and armor? You can. Prefer ranged combat and increased mobility? Sure. Want magic or even summoning? It s there. Mix-and-match? Absolutely. Certain points in the quality tiers are gated behind boss battles - this creates an incentive to master existing tools and also means you aren t forced to come up with your own goals like in other sandbox games there are already key challenges prepared. Additionally there are overall world states - time isn t frozen like in every other game. If you ignore (whether accidentally or purposely) the spread of the Corruption or Crimson some biomes can be lost - sometimes for good (though you can always roll new worlds). This means you have additional optional goals of building barriers and safe zones. You aren t just building empty monuments bereft of function and meaning. You can literally ""save the world"" and put as little or as much effort into it as you prefer. As if that wasn t enough there are also specific themed events that can happen - from as minor as a brief slime rain to as major as an alien invasion or complete world mode change. NPCs can be recruited some appearing when you fulfill specific criteria (and have available housing for them to move in to) while others have to be rescued. While not fleshed out like RPG characters they do have personality and many offer services or sell you unique things. The game also supports multiplayer and does it well. This is one of the rare few games I ve bought over multiple platforms - PS3 Vita PS4 and here on GoG. Completely worth the asking price and a steal when on sale.

The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter - Collector S Edition Upgrade, This game uses photogrammetry to accurately represent real objects in 3D environments. It s hands down the best looking game I ve ever played. Rocks have interesting mossy growth and cracks. Buildings have stains wear from the elements. It s just a level of detail I ve never seen duplicated anywhere else in the medium. The wallpapers are simply stunning because of it. The music is fantastic. It s dripping with atmosphere but it never goes over the top. I listen to it all the time while working. It s unsettling enough that it keeps me alert and focused but it s not distracting. It s a great soundtrack. The digital maps are really cool but don t look at them until you ve played the game since they have spoilers.

Iron Storm, The game is set in ww1 that continued into the 60. With a other warlord crushing the bolshevik revolution and it is weirdly enough all about money. Like the beran s army makes new weapons and sells them. But i don t understand to who there selling like bunkers and armored trains but i m just looking too much into it. Gameplay wise it s a mess you have barley any feedback in hitting something or getting hit the guns are odd you don t really have a croshair but a round cirkel in the middel. You can only aim with some weapons like the sniper rifle or well every scoped weapon. Using anything without a scope is just a spray and prey. But even with a scope i son t think 100% accurate. But now let s talk about the levels and the objectives. All levels are very liniar with some side ways you can make which just lead you to like a mg to mow down some enemies but the objective are basicly geuss work. They don t tell you anything well sometimes here and there but that is it. I used to watch a guide on some parts since i hade no fu... i mean freaking idea what i was supposed to do. Or were i ahd to go. Now let s talk about enemies and there anoying and cheap placement. Firsltly the AI is terrible i saw them shooting walls because i was there once that was the last place they saw me on the other side of the wall. But outside of that snipers are a nightmare you can just walk around and you re dead yiu don t know from were you shot you i used to just listen to the sound and hope i saw them before getting shot. And then there are the guys with FREAKING FULL AUTOMATIC ROCKET LAUNCHERS THEY SOMETIMES SPAWN RIGHT BEHIND YOU IN A HALLWAY. I had moments were i was just walking around and boom i was dead. But all these problems a side. Butr all these problems aside i restarted the a week later when i got stuck somewere out of frustartion. But when i knew what i ahd to do and knew the enemie placement.

Primordia, But doesn t hold up to the storytelling of its forefathers. The level design and art style is very good if you like 90s era SCUMM games. The story will be quite engaging unless you have read at least a bit of Gibson/Asimov/Lem if you have you may be a bit bored as the plot is standard fare nothing groundbreaking quite predictable. The puzzles for the most part are well designed but there were two in particular that were needlessly obtuse to the point that there was no way to figure them out other than using a walkthrough or random chance. The latter half of the game is padded by a lot of unlocking doors. I mean a ridiculous amount of the last half of the game is spent not advancing the story or learning new lore but trying to figure out how to unlock some door or other. Also hampering the story is the fact that all the characters are nearly emotionless (they have sarcasm chips) robots which are hard to connect to or sympathize with. , October 11 2018, But doesn t hold up to the storytelling of its forefathers,brewer8372,a
Startopia, GoG is full of reviews declaring the aforementioned game as  the best of its kind . This review is one more of those; Startopia from Mucky Foot is the best Bullfrog game ever made. It is the culmination of all the design principles that made Bullfrog s economic management sims like Theme Park and Theme Hospital fantastic coupled with an offbeat sense of humour inspired by Douglas Adams (to whom the game is dedicated). The game simulates the economic management of a dilapidated toriodal space station. There are 10 missions to complete which each take a few hours and touch on the games various mechanics which are diverse but consistently entertaining; everything from trading with passing merchant ships providing tourist attractions medical facilities security farming on the biodeck and waging war with other station. Most of the game is quite hands-off. You personally manage the maintenance droids and hire staff from station visitors but this is not an RTS; orders are more like suggestions and things like building or attacking are only done when someone is available to do them. This is also like other Bullfrog games for better or worse a very light simulation. You won t be micromanaging imports and exports you ll be focussing on the routine jobs like harvesting crops and managing trading and the big picture planning in designing how your station is going to look. But where this game shines is how seamless everything behind the scenes is managed. Bullfrog games always focus on having fun and this one is no exception; I never felt hamstrung by the lack of control instead empowered by it to do things my way. With it s quirky Hitchhiker sense of humour colourful graphics and thematic sci-fi music every part of this game is consistent and enjoyable.

Super Hexagon, Probably a very good game for skilled gamer but absolutely atrocious for the other who will prefer watching powerplays to benefit from the fabulous music is little bit more than 30 sec. I found this game so frustrating I had to just stop and resign. I would say it lacks some Hardless mode or at least some options to set the way the cursor can be moved (not only 360?? but also track by track like an Audiosurf) and the zoom / camera is handled. Making an unscrupulously difficult game is a design choice I totally respect but with some more ways to capture and help poor-skilled players understand and improve - or simply profit - as many other difficult games already did (Terry with VVVVVV Dark Souls Crypt of the Necrodancer Furi etc.) could have made the game even greater or even the greatestestest.

Even the primary skills feel redundant but the list of minor skills just goes on forever and you need to dedicate too many levels up to work something minor like your map up to a competent level. ??? Many items abilities and spells are redundant. Why ever bring a torch for light when you can use cat s eyes for ultravision or learn a stronger spell when fire dart is simply more efficient? ??? Inventory management is poor. Moving items about is a fiddly business and bringing an item out to invoke it is often more trouble than it is worth. For a bit more fun there s an arbitrary weight limit in addition to an item limit. ??? Survival elements because reasons. This and the third game have optional survival elements something that even the most hardened GMs don t bother with in most games because they re so easy to trivialize. And they re easy to trivialize in this game as well. Don t bother activating this feature. , August 19 2018, Eschalon has the potential to be very charming,glover,a
Elminage Gothic, This onscreen torture device is worth Zero stars but I cannot post this unless I give it at least one star. This is by far the worst RPG I???ve ever encountered. The UI is a mess all controls are completely non intuitive and in fact have no logic to them whatsoever. To those who say this is like Wizardry I ask ???Have you actually played Wizardry???? First and foremost this game bills itself as a Dungeon Crawler there is no crawling as the graphics are horrendous and not just emulating the graphics of old but simply awful to look at. Movement is with keyboard which is normally fine however in this game you can move forward or turn only with the keyboard but must switch to the mouse to open doors or interact with things. Combat is the dumbest I???ve ever seen; it is no different than playing a card game and therefore b-o-r-i-n-g in the extreme and again the graphics fail to improve it in any way. The graphics are static and totally generic as if borrowed from a game for a phone and this means combat has zero movement as in moving seems to have zero movement. The combat is wooden and fixed and completely random in its results which are heavily weighed in favor of the monsters so expect your characters to die frequently and to loose all their possessions when they do. The inventory system seems to have been created as an afterthought it is the worst I have ever tried to use and everything from; buying items equipping and item trading items amongst the party members to trying to determine what an item actually does is horribly executed. Your characters have only ten (10) inventory slots so don???t expect to gather much of anything also if you discard anything it goes to some nebulous garbage dump somewhere according to the manual which I never found as I lost complete interest in the game within the first half hour of playing it. Overall there is absolutely nothing laudable about this abomination pretending to be an RPG and I could go on for many pages describing it???s multitude of glaring faults so I will simply say save your money as this is not even worth downloading even it was free. , September 11 2018, This onscreen torture device is worth Zero stars but I cannot post this unless I give it at least one star,everett,a
The Red Strings Club, If you like adventure games I d say you know already know what you like and what you re looking for -- so you will probably enjoy this. I picked this up particularly for the theme (neo-noir sci-fi) and I loved the style/art design. There are heavy-handed messages in here so if that s not your thing you might not like that.. but I liked it.. a lot. I understand some people felt it may be telling you how to think/feel however I thought completely differently -- it seemed the game was consistently assessing what I believed and why also how some of those assessments may be hypocritical. Asks more questions then tries to feed you answers (IMO). ANYWAY highly recommend this game for those who like some philosophy in their games. , October 7 2018, If you like adventure games I d say you know already know what you like and what you re looking for -- so you will probably enjoy this,cannon,a

Dead Cells, Premi??re chose ?? dire : DeadCells n est pas un M??troidVania mais un rogue-like dont l aspect graphique se rapproche d un Castlevania. Personellement je trouve les graphismes sympas mais ??a n est pas ?? mon sens du pixel art. Les diff??rents environnements en tendance ?? se ressembler les uns les autres ce qui est un peu dommage. Les musiques collent bien avec le style g??n??ral mais elles aussi ont trop tendance ?? se ressembler. Sur le fond le soft est clairement port?? sur des m??caniques d un jeu d action en 2D - il faudra faire preuve d agilit?? sur le pad pour enchainer attaques fr??n??tiques esquives et utilisation intelligente de ses pouvoirs pour s en sortir en prenant le moins de coups possibles. La progression est typique du rogue-like : plus on avance plus on d??bloque des armes et des povoirs qui permettent de recomencer avec de meilleurs chances de succ??s. Le bestaire n est pas tr??s vari?? - 20 ennemis dif??rents ?? la louche - mais chaque ennemi doit ??tre envisag?? selon une strat??gie sp??cifique ce qui donne lieu ?? des combats int??r??ssants selon la configuration pr??sente et leur disposition. Alors pourquoi 5 ??toiles ? En fait DeadCells m a s??duit au fur et ?? mesure car malgr?? certains d??fauts que j ai ??voqu?? plus haut il reste tr??s solide en terme de gameplay. Je me suis pris au fil des parties ?? perfectionner mes approches sans qu apparaisse de lassitude gr??ce ?? la nervosit?? de ses m??caniques. La rejouabilit?? est r??elle car quand on termine la partie on d??bloque une nouvelle difficult?? et ainsi de suite.

Project Warlock, As a big fan of Doom Hexen Blood and Duke i enjoyed this game. I think it is a fantastic love letter to those games while at the same time standing on its own feet. It has some mechanics and a killer soundtrack that make it stand out from the crowd. Gameplay: More arcadey then Doom but not in a bad way. If you enjoy classic 90 s FPS youll feel at home for the most part -Guns all feel very nice with great sound and impactful shots. -The run and walk speeds both feel balanced. Running at mach speed in open areas circle strafing is awesome -Enemy projectiles are fun to doge both in the corridors and open areas. -Levels are a nice mix of open and claustrophobic areas. I feel it shines in the open areas more so - The upgrade system for guns and magic are enjoyable to use with a way to adapt to any play style though i do feel magic lacks a bit in some areas. Both are very fun to play with - I really wish thier was a difficulty between normal and hardcore. Hardcore is basically ultra nightmare from Doom for Project Warlock -Secrets are very rewarding to find -Only a mini map is alright but i would like an overall map in game you can pull up -Each episode takes place somewhere entirley different adding new enemies and variety Graphics: Games has really nice artwork and a great look to it. - The effect of the enemies being chipped away as you damage them is nicley done - Atmospere and lighting is well done though i do think some areas are just a bit to dark - If you like horror the game has some awesome nods to game and film that i wont spoil - Each episodes theme is very well done in both enemy design and levels. From Egypt to the Arctic youll see alot -Wont go above 1080p i wish they change this though it looks fine on my 2k monitor Sound: Soundtrack is killer. Literally every song is a banger and fun to play to - Guns have impactful sounds -Soundtrack kills Tldr: Its alot of fun. I wish they add more lighting above 1080p res another difficulty level , November 6 2018, As a big fan of Doom Hexen Blood and Duke i enjoyed this game,contreras4491,a
Frostpunk," Apart from the severe starting problems you have when you have not installed every update available for Windows 7 it runs fine. Be warned if you like Sim City or similar and expect something like this - it is nowhere in that direction. You will play scenario only and the game is made up like a browser game and not like a simulation. Events are scripted and you will always follow the same goals. The atmosphere is fine - postapocalyptic and if you like those kind of sad stories you will probably like this one. Gameplay handling and everything seems polished and I had no ""wtf"" moments once you got the grip of it. Difficulty is very well balanced sometimes you fail if you do not set your priorities right but not so much it would seem to difficult. You are essentially stuck at your city with a small defined space to build on - no map no world. Outside events are just story and sending scouts to locations on a larger map.

Elex," This text is written with a few months of distance. Elex is a direct successor to the Gothic / Risen games utilizing pretty much the same techniques at story telling world bulding and character progression. Elex basically suffers from being outdated in almost every aspect. While quite a few reviewers praise that as being ""oldschool"" or ""true to the spirit"" it s basically really just the inevitable result of trying to compete with the current wave of open world games. The Good: The world is rather well crafted you can see that they tried to supplement the overall experience by telling little stories via the environment. Walking around trying to explore is fun. The bad: The GRAPHICS are... okayish. The world is colorful the textures are fine although the rough terrein geometry speaks volumes about the aging rendering engine holding everything together (used in Gothic then Risen then Elex). But the animations are horrible. What really left me speechless is the fact that they used THE SAME SMOKING ANIMATION FROM GOTHIC 1! And yes it already did look awkward back then! Even worse NPC models are reused so frequently. The MUSIC is neither standing out in terms of good or bad. It s just there. The VOICE ACTING is plain horrible no matter if you play in English or German. Especially the protagonist just makes your eyes roll. The NARRATIVE feels worth digging into but unfortunately due to the uninspired WRITING you won t feel very invested in finding out about the world or the NPC inhabiting it. Unfortunately people are as shallow as a mud puddle. The quests involve a lot of running back and fro basically reducing it to fetch item / find person with intermittent frequent combat situations. The COMBAT / SKILL PACING... is what ruins the game. Pacing is horrible. After hours of gameplay you still are reduced to run away from almost everything spamming arrows from elevated positions. The game lacks flow and immersion. It s a dull experience. ", October 30 2018, This text is written with a few months of distance,martin,a

Furi - One More Fight," Furi is most definitiely among the best games on GOG. The type of games I enjoy range from Prince of Persia (2008 one was great as well!) Cuphead The Last Express Witcher 3 the list goes on. This game is exactly what you expect it to be boss battles. The challenge is steep but rewarding. Each boss has several ""stages"" and every time you encounter them you get a little bit further and you re encouraged to play on! Well at least I was. I m playing it with keyboard and mouse and I managed to beat 2 bosses so far ( I even bought a pc control just for this game). The aesthetic is reminicent of Metal Gear + Color Get it and have fun!

Shelter 2," Lovely game. I must agree that it is different than the Shelter 1. I like both of them. Shelter 1 is great for begginers and also for people who want to have emotional story without a word! This one contains words and is more like a sandbox but still interesting. Few things are a bit annoying for a player of the first game but you get used to it. There are still some things left for the player to explain how he/she likes. And hey lynxes are very cute (well after Shelter 1 I must say that badger is cute too but I did not think about it before). Don t worry you can expect nice bugs (like falling through the terrain in some bushes or on the stones or rabbits running from you in sitting position - but hey they are then quick). If you buy it I recommend to notice the ""Saving"" caption in the right bottom corner. Because if you mess something from last Saving moment you can hit Esc and select Load and get back to last save point. But not further. And another thing you don t need to finish with any cub but it is preferable to end with at least one. ", December 15 2017, Lovely game,wilkinson,a

Gnog, It s hard to knock on GNOG. As an exploration of color and shape it s executed flawlessly. As a game not so much. The game is a collection of similar unrelated stages. Reasoning your way through them will only take you so far and what starts as a psychedelic and relaxing exploration hits a frustrating wall. You ll eventually resort to clicking blindly looking up a walkthrough or putting the game down altogether. The Lab-O and Hom-3 levels are particularly egregious but it s a consistent struggle. Controls feel derived from a mobile port and are particularly frustrating with the Vive motion controllers. You ll mostly need to hold trigger to activate while moving your arm in a wholly unrelated direction for all interactions. It s probably better on a flat screen or even better a tablet where the act of tapping blindly wouldn t feel as silly. One to watch rather than play I m afraid. , August 18 2018, It s hard to knock on GNOG,glass,a
Kathy Rain, Kathy Rain is an atmospheric and well written adventure game set in small town America in 1995. The writing and voice acting is excellent with believeable dialogue. The pixel art is gorgeous capturing the feel of an early 90s adventure game perfectly. Conwell springs is a moody town seeming to be under perpetually grey autumn skies punctuated by frequent showers. This suits the tone well though that s not to say it s unrelentingly bleak. There s some good jokes in there and Kathy is a likeable protagonist. She s smart tough and won t back away froma fight with a biting sense of humor. But she s human too displaying moments of vulnerablity and sadness showing her as a complete character rather than a simple archetype. The ending is a little underwhelming I felt they didn t really explain everything but I think that may have been intentional to leave the player something to think about afterward. I d love to see a sequel. , November 3 2018, Kathy Rain is an atmospheric and well written adventure game set in small town America in 1995,fuller,a
Regalia: Of Men And Monarchs, This is an okay game. The music is alright the dialog is funny and the characters are quirky. The text adventure writing is good and some of the lore is actually interesting. The game doesn t beat you over the head with the lore either. Even if you don t pay that much attention you can still understand which faction people are talking about. The battles are boring tho. Every character slowly walks to the enemy and the animations are not good. This makes the battles feel slow with no drama. I feel no rush when fighting. Also there is no job system. A characters role skills and equipment are static (with the exception of a few skill morphs). When new weapons are available you simply look at which one has better stats. No decisions deeper than bigger numbers. Same goes for the two trinkets you can equip. The whole party gains experience tho which is nice. Thankfully the game gives you the option to increase your parties damage to make battles a breeze so you can get back to the story. , July 7 2018, This is an okay game,carney,a

Maize," Frankly I don t get how all the muppets around here can give this game 5 stars. It s far from worthy of such a high rating. Don t get me wrong the game is good but that s ALL it is: JUST GOOD. It has some clever-ish writing some decently funny dialogue some amusing little puzzles and I ll admit that the late-game bits have some nice li l surprizes that re both clever and entertaining. But all in all the game isn t that great. For one it s horribly poorly optimized. This s probably due to the developerschoice of engine. As anyone with even one fraction of a functioning brain knows by now the Unreal 3 engine is one of the absolutely WORST engines on the market today in no small part because of its extremely poor optimization. There s also the issue that you can t change the controls in the game. AT ALL. Seriously. What the hell Finish Line?! How could you miss something THAT obvious?! Adding to that there s also no option for having non-cutscene captions so if you ve got a hearing impairment you re gonna miss out on A LOT of funny dialogue during the gameplay. Not to mention the issue that you can t view the extras/collectables you ve collected during the gameplay without loading your game. So yeah. There s no ""Extras"" section on the main menu screen. None whatsoever. How could you have missed that? I mean come ON. Then of course we come to the absolutely biggest issue I have with the game: replayability. Granted not all games are meant to be replayed over and over again but if your game can t be replayed at all without severely diminishing its overall impact then that game is a pretty spectacular failure as entertainment. I wouldn t have minded the non-replayable nature of Maize if it hadn t been so bloody short! Barely six hours and then it s done. And that s WITH a 100% completion ratio as well! So all in all it s a nice li l morsel of a game. But for the love of dogs DO NOT believe all the senseless fans gushing about 5/5 ratings!

88 Heroes, 88 Heroes is a pretty fun and funny game. It takes a lot of inspiration from the kind of mean unfair games like I Wanna Be The Guy while still being fair and friendly and eminently playable even by sausage-fingered n00bs like myself. The difficulty in the levels is mostly the sort of thing you need patience to pull of perfectly - and you will eventually run out of patience and do something stupid and you can only blame yourself for it. Usually. The game is so so close to have perfectly tight gameplay that would make it shine. It s so close that when it slips up and you fall off an elevator you were clearly in into a spike pit or get crushed between an elevator and a wall that weren t even close it hurts way more than if the game was bad all the way through. And this hurts the game a lot more than it d hurt an easy-going platformer. It adds up to levels that are often complex and confusing (which is good and nice) and lots of different characters with different jump arcs and movement velocities (also good and nice). Another bad thing about the game is that... it ends up being boring. Some of the characters are crazy and can fly shoot stuff float reconfigure the level in all sorts of ways and it s excellent. But a lot of them - a real big bunch of them - just jump. So every level has to be able to be completed by a character that does nothing but jump and usually does that by having a slow methodical route you ll be forced to take with most character. The end result is that many of them feel the same and even if they aren t there s no difference between two attack-focused characters in areas without enemies. However I still really love the game. It s charming well-drawn and can somehow make stupid catchphrase humour really funny. And the characters are so charming designed with such love it s a real delight to watch them move and jump and duck (especially try ducking). It s a game that makes me sad for what it could be but I m glad it exists. , March 23 2018, 88 Heroes is a pretty fun and funny game,stuart3431,a

Masquerada: Songs And Shadows," As their first PC release Masquerada: Songs and Shadows is a great start for Witching Hour Studios. Overlooked at release I stumbled onto this game by chance and I don t regret it one bit! With a title involving the word ""songs"" you d hope that the music in this game was up to scratch and fear not! By far the standout features lies in its sounds. It s music is spectacular and it s strongest asset whilst it s voice acting is superb from its cast of experienced voice actors. Art wise it is very good. I m not an art person so I m not the best to judge in that aspect but it was...uh ""very good?"" as an isometric rpg the camera is set so it can help emphasis the art though there is room for improvemnts as not much ""pop s out"" or makes you go ""woah"". Plot wise- It s solid with some twists and turns nothing too predicatble but the ending does leave itself quite open to a sequel with a fair few unresolved plot threads. The writing sometimes jumps around a bit though and can at times be a little inconsistent. Gameplay wise it is an isometric rpg with both action bars and real time pausing. It s fine. Nothing spectacular. It does it s job with you controlling your main character with the option to switch to 2 others. Each character has up to 4 skills to choose from with a special. These are selected from a skill tree (there are no levels in this game and skill points are doled out at certain points in the story but don t stress 1/3 through the game this becomes fairly easy to completly readjust and change your skill tree). Lore wise? There is ALOT. If you enjoy reading Lore you ll have a blast. Exploration is very limited often you cannot return to a previous area which was be a bit annoying. Furthermore there are still a few minor bugs in the game but nothing gamebreaking just a bit irritating.

The Original Strife: Veteran Edition, I remember wanting this game so badly in the 90s. I played the Demo over and over again. Then over the last 20 years I slowly forgot about it. Then when I saw it on GOG it all came rushing back and I jumped at the chance to play the game I desired so long ago. Like the title says it holds up very well! They have made it nice and smooth for mouse and keyboard controls by default set up to the modern standard. It has a fun semi-nonliniar story in a small open world style. Yes it s an old game so the areas are very small but the level design is interesting and never so cryptic that I got stuck for very long when looking for the next switch/boss/story event.

Dream Pinball 3D," Dream Pinball 3D is a game that I own on 3 different platforms. It s not because the game is good it s because I m a lunatic for pinball sims and will play them in pretty much any form they exist. Dream Pinball offers six tables but you d hardly know it based on the tables themselves. All of them are exceedingly similar in design which is a problem given that the core design of them isn t very compelling. If you re familiar with actual pinball tables such as those featured in the incredible ""Pinball Arcade"" collection also known as Pinball Hall of Fame in earlier iterations then you ll realize immediately that these tables aren t designed with real pinball in mind - no thoughtfully made pinball table is designed like these. There is very little ""flow"" to the tables the copious amount of extra flippers are often located in areas that merely send the ball into a wall of bumpers and many of them are too hidden to reliably make use of them. Despite designed to look like a modern complex table all six Dream Pinball tables play like older tables in that you re basically just slapping at targets except without the rhyme or reason that even classic tables featured. Timed modes exist and every table includes Multiball but these modes lack purpose. Ordinarily Multiball is accompanied by a jackpot shot usually on a ramp but that doesn t appear to be the case here for the most part. In fact I recall a table the one called ""Monsters"" where you re urged to shoot 3 spot targets during multiball for a reward of 1 Million points. Problem is those same targets actually offer significantly more points if completed during single-ball play. What s the point? If you re like me and just want pinball - ANY pinball - then it might offer serviceable play for you but I can t sit here and tell you that the tables are especially exciting. Their relatively lifeless pinball tables that don t compel you to really take your time to learn the table and come to master it.

Quest For Infamy, For those who have played the  Quest for Glorygames you ll find many familiar elements in  Quest for Infamy . In  Infamyyou get to play one of three playable classes: Brigand Sorcerer and Rogue. Also similar is the random enemy encounter when the protagonist ventures out of a town in a valley that acts as his home base. I chose to play as a Rogue. I figured that if my character a pre-named and voiced one called Roehm is on a quest for infamy I might as well play a class that isn t that honourable. It turns out that Roehm isn t seeking infamy but just doing whatever it takes for him to get out of the Valley of Krasna. Roehm is a selfish rascal at best. Overall  Infamyis an uneven game. There are some notable strengths: the forest backdrops were beautifully illustrated; histories of places were well fleshed out; each character class has its own unique set of sidequests; a large locale that is fun to explore. In these regards  Infamybests  QFG1 to which it most resembles. These strengths only make it a pity that other aspects of  Infamyweren t just as well done. There is an inconsistency in the style in which the backgrounds (i.e. non-forest ones) and character portraits were drawn. It took me out of the game when I saw characters whose portraits clearly resembled Toby Jones and Rowan Atkinson. While  QFGis witty  Infamyis cheeky at best. Cheeky isn t bad if the lines of dialogue are delivered in the right way. However many of the voice acting is horrible let alone terribly recorded. I wish the developers had spent more effort into refining the script seeking better voice actors and recording. At the end of the day  Infamyis overly ambitious. It tries emulating the  QFGseries but also pays homage to other genres that doesn t fit well with the core concept. Still I still appreciate it for its ambition some parts of which actually turned out really well. In spite of its flaws I ll still recommend  Infamyto all  QFGfans. , October 22 2018, For those who have played the  Quest for Glorygames you ll find many familiar elements in  Quest for Infamy ,serrano5407,a
Inked, I bought Inked on launch based on its visual style alone. For the first hour I was rather pleased with the game. The visuals in-game are just as gorgeous as they look in the trailer and complement the gameplay well. However as I got further into the game it began to get tedious. The unnamed hero walks slowly and I dreaded going back to a puzzle or other sequence after dying. Now after finishing the game I don t want to go back to rescue the birds for 100% completion. It would be too much of a chore. Furthermore after a point the game became unplayable with my controller; I couldn t place blocks as quickly as I needed to solve some puzzles. Just placing the pieces needed to solve these puzzles was sometimes a problem as they would lock somewhere else. This was a big problem in one end-game section which I ultimately abandoned. The game is short; my play through was just under eight hours and that was with considerable time wasted on certain timed puzzles. It s up to you whether this much play time justifies the cost. Overall however I d recommend just watching a Let s Play on YouTube. , October 16 2018, I bought Inked on launch based on its visual style alone,blackwell4019,a

Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two, First off I d like to point out that this game is getting a lot of terrible reviews due to increased system requirements episode releases being late exclusively on GOG and from people who are hating on Telltale for making a Season Two for Minecraft: Story Mode rather than The Last Frontier The Wolf Among Us or Game of Thrones. Don t be fooled by those reviews they have absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the game. Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two is undeniably my favorite game of all time! Let s first talk about how the first season transitions into this. You do not have to have played Season One for this to make sense and be fun but I will tell you that it is ten times better if you do. The games graphics quality is just splendid! A terrific step up from the first series and with far better lip-sync. As is the voice acting which sounds smooth and flawlessly fits in with the characters in-game. Moving onto this game s specific features it is everything I could ask for in a story game! The world is incredibly designed and super immersive and the characters- man where do I start!- they re just perfect! You feel so much of everything do they and for everything they say. Telltale hits all the right notes and at times this game has left me completely breathless with anticipation of many different types. The game introduces new mechanics like bringing in some retro Minecraft-style building just to remind you of its origins as well as new characters and much much tougher decisions that leave many people stumped. It s a true Telltale classic and I hope that they keep up the quality they ve displayed here with all their future games! , November 25 2017, First off I d like to point out that this game is getting a lot of terrible reviews due to increased system requirements episode releases being late exclusively on GOG and from people who are hating on Telltale for making a Season Two for Minecraft: Story Mode rather than The Last Frontier The Wolf Among Us or Game of Thrones,rosa,a
Bio Menace, I loved this game as a teenager but looking back at it now it leaves something to be desired. The atmosphere is great - a cheesy platformer with a 90 s action hero. A lot of bloody scenes with the cartoon-like monsters. The controls are typical of the time. They suffice but do not live up to todays expectation. The worst part is the steep difficulty curve over episodes. Episode 3 has levels that you can set in an unwinnable state. This is due to the fact that all level elements do not respawn after death. Like platforms that disintegrate only exist once - die after using one and you can never get back! Only play this one out of nostalgia or if you like similar games of the era and know what to expect. Personally I only find episode one enjoyable - lots of variation and it shows all the features of the game. , November 4 2018, I loved this game as a teenager but looking back at it now it leaves something to be desired,carlson,a

Trine 2: Complete Story, I love this game but I still prefer Trine 1. The reasons: - Trine 1 had an inventory system and you were able to find neat items in chests along the way. - The puzzles in Trine 2 are sometimes a little strange and even illogical at some points. It can occur that you have to be pixel-precise with your actions. - The new skill tree is pointless for the most part. My favourite skill from the first game was the ability to latch on to objects the sorcerer created. That gave you more possibilities to solve puzzles. When it come to graphics Trine 2 looks a bit better than the first one and it s probably the most beautiful game I ve ever seen! , March 17 2018, I love this game but I still prefer Trine 1,castaneda,a
Adom (Ancient Domains Of Mystery), Since the roguelike genre has come to include a rather wide variety of games like FTL Binding of Isaac or Dead Cells it s important to note that ADOM is a  trueroguelike. No unlocks. No progress carried over between games. No second chances. Just you and a gigantic maze of random numbers to navigate. In terms of gameplay I feel ADOM is close to Tales of Maj Eyal but perhaps even more unforgiving. There s a large variety of monsters and traps but even your inventory is full of risks. A single wrong click can doom your character. Which is exactly what most people look for in a roguelike: a huge amount of variables with multiple strategies for dealing with them. The biggest downside to ADOM is the constant crashes. For some reason there is no autosave between floors or anything. I ve lost like five charactes to crashes after five hours of gametime truly absurd. , October 13 2018, Since the roguelike genre has come to include a rather wide variety of games like FTL Binding of Isaac or Dead Cells it s important to note that ADOM is a  trueroguelike,calhoun3592,a

The Darkside Detective, This is a funny point and click adventure that I???ve really enjoyed playing. You play as Francis McQueen with his side-kick Dooley to solve the Darkside cases. There are the main 6 cases along with 3 bonus cases. I???m itching for more though the third case is the ???season 1 finale???. (And there is definitely a Darkside Detective 2 coming out in 2020 and there???s a kickstarter for it at the moment). The puzzles are simple easy. The combination of items and using them is a bit cartoony with logic. I found the cases to be memorable and unique and I had all around fun with it. The humor is good but may not please everyone. It???s about a 3 hour game for myself.

Earth 2150 Trilogy," Hm a sequel to 2140. RTS. It s a bit better this time around. This one comes with two stand-alone expansion packs: Moon Project which adds units and harder campaign and Lost Souls which is just even harder mission pack. To make the game not freeze when you open an important construction window by pressing F1 I think you have to set game s resolution to 4:3 aspect ratio while having it run on OpenGL. Also videos in expansions packs didn t play until I went to deep webz to install video codecs. Now I am still sad as those videos don t run smoothly. And what can I say. The developers once again tries to stay at the top of a game in gameplay this time bringing innovation of being able to ""create"" your own units by choosing a chassis and 1-2 equipments. No infantry. Slow research but it s usually for whole campaign or maybe you have to create multiple research buildings. Very slow unit construction but that s why you must build multiple buildings. Interesting campaign in original which meshes main base with your mission bases can use transport inbetween. There is one more faction up to three and they feel even more different making it more interesting. Some very basic terraforming by building bridges or trenches or going underground. And once again they managed to make playing the game feel unappealing. This time mostly due to combination of slow pace and not being able to alt-tab while somehow being slightly bland. Or uncomfortable. Not sure. Though it s mostly due to lack of balance in campaign. LC is actually easy mode UCS is medium and ED is a hard mode in original game despite it being in opposite order. Also tutorial sucks you need much more units to win it than it tells you more buildings and research much earlier. I bet that more than enough players just quit due to how ""hard"" it was haha. But eh. It s eh. But it s a better more innovate eh than eh 2140. I like my eh 2150 sometimes especially with all the light at night in-game it s pretty.

Torment: Tides Of Numenera - Immortal Edition Upgrade," There are two kinds of people I can imagine not liking this game: those who didn t know what they were getting into and kickstarter backers disappointed by overly ambitious promises that weren t kept. (Note: they are still supporting this game with free updates. Gamers interested in consumer advocacy should support it.) If you think that a game with pretty stimulating visuals and isometric backgrounds - but also under-animated characters that fills in the gaps with descriptive text - would irk you... stay away? If you consider yourself the kind of person who does or SHOULD enjoy reading and if you like outlandish sci-fi grab this game. If you have enjoyed a visual novel grab this game. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure where you travel between story nodes on an isometric map if you will. Let the descriptions wash over you as you fall into an eddy of despair that crosses dimensions ponder what a tesseract might look like and negotiate with entities so powerful that you might as well be ""an ant waging war against the seasons."" I loved Bloodborne. It is a contender for my favorite game but Bloodborne s cosmic horror aspect takes a distant second to Numenera. Undertale would also be a contender. This game is like a mature Undertale. (Some violence is inevitable though seeing as you might enter a battle with evil itself.) This game is imperfect. It didn t quite nail the ending in the same way Planescape did. The combat lacks the flashiness that Planescape s combat occasionally had as well. As mentioned previously the characters are visually ugly and poorly animated. Those are my only complaints. FYI I took the minimum combat high ""Intellect"" route completed every sidequest I could find and tried as best I could to accept my failures as canon only seldom reloading the game. Perhaps that could give you the most mileage. I have only completed one playthrough but I intend to play again. I will consider this game one of my classical treasures.

Lost Eden," The  90s had a lot of FMV games most of which were cheesy even back then and have visuals that have aged like bread. This isn t quite one of those games; I was surprised at how well a lot of the visuals held up. Yes there are lengthy video sequences when you go ANYWHERE but to me there s a sort of charm in that. You can also skip them by clicking so if it s not your thing no need to worry. This doesn t just ride on that novelty either; while most of the puzzles aren t really that complex or challenging the tasks are interesting to complete and go well with the story. You re a young prince trying to rally all humanoid and dinosaur species together to fight against a group of what I think is more aggressive dinosaurs - it doesn t really explain that very well - but to that end you explore different valleys finding different groups of living beings and convincing them to band together. Yes you will be doing a lot of the same things (giving mushrooms to brontosauruses giving nests to the triceratops etc.) and some people might call that ""repetitive"" but I like to think of it as consistent in this case; there are new experiences to be had in each valley to keep things fresh but when you arrive you at least have a basic goal in mind and a good idea of how to go about it. What I found really neat was that each valley has an overworld map which can be used to travel quickly but also tells you just where you are and how to get back to things you ve already found. The game is nobody s masterpiece but I feel like it does a lot of unique interesting things and that was enough for me. I ve always wanted one of these kinds of games but didn t have a good enough computer when they were relevant and now that I can finally play them this did not disappoint.

Costume Quest, The idea is cute and full of possibilities. Real monsters kidnap your sibling on Halloween and you have to rescue them. However the schtick is that your costume gives you the real powers of whatever is depicted. Basically the game is exploration mini games and Pok??mon style combat. Remarkably the combat is even more limited than Pok??mon. Each costume has one default attack and then a special that can be activated every three turns. There s also an add on slot which you can use for one extra - be it another attack or a boost to your existing powers. Play with a game pad because the game features quasi QTE - every home attack can be boosted or enemy attack partially blocked by a timed button press. You need to be able to do this reasonably consistently to win fights. Levelling up boosts your powers and hit points but there are no choices on levelling up. The main graphics are cute for the main characters and generally okay if nothing special for the backgrounds. Character interaction is pretty limited and not particularly amusing. Game balance is reasonably good. I struggled to find a final house to Trick or Treat during the first level stumbled out of the dark third level by accident and there was only one fight towards the beginning which took several attempts. Game structure isn t great. You reach the two end battles without much fanfare - almost as if the game was planned to be larger and stopped prematurely. The first of the final two battles I redid once because I didn t have the right kit the final one I nailed first time This is a great intro game for younger children who may appreciate its simplicity. Overall though the premise probably deserved a better game. I bought this in the last sale for a buck and at that price it s good value. But you might be left wishing that a more ambitious game had been attempted with such interesting possibilities. , January 16 2018, The idea is cute and full of possibilities,irwin,a

Sur le papier c est merveilleux : un RPG d??vopp?? pour la Megadrive puis port?? sur diff??rentes machines avec une tr??s belle couche  HDqui porte ?? la fois sur les graphismes et la musique. Pour ma part j ai ??t?? subjugu?? par le d??but de l aventure qui promettait beaucoup ! On est intrigu?? par l histoire et le pass?? des personnages principaux et il va falloir avancer pour en savoir plus. Le jeu a un faux air de Lunar jeu qui m avait tout litt??ralement passionn?? ?? l ??poque. Comme dans Lunar on visite diff??rentes r??gions tr??s vari??es avec leur identit?? propre. Mon coup de coeur sur Pier Solar ce sont les passages de for??ts et jungles que je trouve tr??s r??ussis avec leur ambiance et leurs jeux de lumi??re et de p??nombre ! En tant que RPG tous les ingr??dients habituels sont pr??sents avec quelques surprises dont diff??rents mini-jeux bourr??s de clins d oeil ?? d autres jeux. Quelques b??mols cependant : d abord la lin??arit?? : il n est que rarement possible de faire marche arri??re et il est impossible de se balader o?? l on veut ?? la mani??re d un FF. Autre probl??me : c??t?? sc??nario le jeu reste dans du tr??s classique et ne s autorise ni twists ni forte dramaturgie qui aurait pu faire s envoler l histoire. C est pour moi le plus gros d??faut du jeu : il ne cherche jamais ?? nous surprendre fortement. Les combats quant ?? eux sont bien pens??s avec diff??rentes m??caniques in??dites dont la principale est une notion de  Kipermettant de  Chargerles comp??tences des personnages qui passent ainsi leur tour pour pouvoir balancer une grosse attaque au tour suivant. Cette charge peut ??galement ??tre transmise ?? un autre personnage pour pouvoir balancer une grosse combo. C est bien trouv??. Les combats sont un poil r??p??titifs mais le petit c??t?? tactique att??nue la lassitude sur le long terme. De plus il est possible de les r??duire voire de les supprimer carr??ment dans le options.

Serpent In The Staglands, Serpent in the Staglands gets many of the hard things right: the setting is one-of-a-kind the art is stellar the casting system is fresh and the music is moody character creation is complex and yet intuitive. But every time the game tries to go in bold new directions it seems to forget how to do the basics. There are bugs EVERYWHERE. Entire UI elements were broken my whole game. Combat is spammy and thoughtless. Although you get wrecked by a lone fox in the beginning after the first few hours you ll only die if you nod off at your keyboard. Everything can be killed via tank and spank. The story has the best premise I ve ever heard and they do absolutely NOTHING with it. The characters are 2D. The ending of the game is a total railroad for an expansion pack that may never see the light of day. It ends on a cliffhanger. If you ve played all of the great cRPGs this is the next one to play.

Plus some bosses and quests need you adapt your army in order to win. And pick spells carefully magic crystals dont lie around in such amounts any more. And the final Battle is quite epic. , November 21 2017, The game is pretty good with lots of interesting additions to the game especially with ice and fire DLC,dalton,a

Ring Runner: Flight Of The Sages," Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages is an unknown gem- didn t even have a steam release at launch. I had never heard of it prior to the day of its launch here on GoG some years ago. A mere ten dollars I gambled on it and it payed off in spades. It s a lovingly crafted 2D top-down space shooter with some heavy RPG elements. At the center of the experience is a brilliantly written campaign full of twists and dry humor about a distant future. Ring Runner offers a compelling fast paced and tactically diverse gameplay experience including about sixty different ship hulls across five distinct ship classes and grouped by power level into five tiers. There are a number of hulls that are hybrids of two or even three classes and a special set of ""Duo"" ships that allow for two player local coop with one player steering the ship and another operating an independent turret. Each class also has passive ""veterancy"" bonuses earned in-game for getting kill streaks but reset if you get blown up. There are hundreds of different components allowing you to customize your loadout to an intense degree. In any game mode including the campaign you earn ""plex"" to spend on researching and purchasing new ship hulls and parts from the lab which act as a sort of experience meter: reaching certain net worth milestones unlocks new prebuilt ships. Add to this a beautiful backgrounds and visual effects fully-functional Newtonian physics an excellent atmospheric soundtrack and steam workshop support so that you can share your ship setups with others and you have a recipe for a game that is I think one in a million. If you enjoy space shooters or action RPGs of any kind you cannot afford to miss Ring Runner.

The Moment Of Silence," The story behind The Moment of Silence is great and as relevant now as it was 14 years ago. However I found myself fighting against the game engine almost all the time trying to trigger scene changes or pixel hunting to find the one point on the screen I have to click. In addition there were several puzzles where I knew EXACTLY what I had to do but the game wanted me to do things in a specific order. Oh you have a VCR a TV and a cable? Cool. Plug the cable into the tv? NOPE. Combine the cable with the VCR? NOPE. use the VCR with the TV? NOPE. Plut the VCR on the TABLE and then connect the cable? Yep. And at no point did my character offer hints that this was the way things should be done. Another puzzle involved me needing to return a key to an unconscious guard. I didn t know that this was what I had to do until I consulted a walkthrough. When I tried to advance all my character said was ""not yet"". Just the addition of a line saying ""better put the key back in his pocket beforte he wakes up"" would have saved me a lot of headscratching. And the final puzzle was SUCH a chore all that running around and adjusting satellite dishes by trial and error? Nope. 2 stars for the story because it s a good-un. But the game frustrates.

Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star, Since I really enjoyed Hatoful Boyfriend I was excited to try this one. But it feels... flat. It s neither a cheerful dating sim nor a particularly thought-provoking dark story which were the things I enjoyed about the original game. Holiday Star has no real branching (or stat raising for that matter) so you re just watching the characters do things rather than being any part of the story. This makes it hard to emotionally invest in any of it. And since it s set during a couple weeks within the original story nothing could be allowed to happen which would affect any of the first game. So with no character growth relationship changes or events with lasting repercussions... what s the point? , March 30 2018, Since I really enjoyed Hatoful Boyfriend I was excited to try this one,sims5416,a
Aarklash: Legacy, This feels like it could have been much more in depth but ended up making it simple like any standard MOBA type game. You start with 4 characters on your team (standard tank healer caster and melee dps) and while there are ways to upgrade them it is very simplistic. You have a few accessories to swap around and each character is has 4 total spells/actions. Each spell can be upgraded and eventually will split into 2 different variations to choose from. However it is not as interesting as it seems because the variation ends up changing the spell to a channeled vs cooldown spell or one option does more damage but the other has some sort of minor crowd control. The difference is usually so negligible that it does not matter which you choose. There are no NPC interactions so no deep kind of gear buying or upgrading and no deep story other than a little prescripted dialogue based on whatever enemy shows on screen. The combat was very difficult but not impossible. You have to utilize the pause button quite often to make sure each of your 4 characters is using the proper skill on the proper bad guy/team member. The game does not autosave regularly so you will quickly learn you will have to do that yourself often. The game looks and sounds good but without more character items spells and NPC interaction you will find it gets repetitive fairly quick. You will moving from area to area battling a random group of 2 to 6 enemies at a time so even if the enemies look different your battles will all feel similar. I liked the fighting style but got bored sooner than I hoped. This was not a bad game just not really my style. , March 22 2018, This feels like it could have been much more in depth but ended up making it simple like any standard MOBA type game,conner,a
The Swindle, Let me start off by saying I loved the swindle. Its fun engaging and a very good heist simulator. but I hated playing it. This game is buggy like really buggy.

This is a game you can quickly play in your lunch break for a round and if you know serious sam meaning you get into a room and shoot every enemy in the face for the door to be opened than you know this game. The main difference is the protagonist and than you can climb up when you push yourself against ledges it is so quick and smooth that it really makes the game better. Honestly I would give it 5 stars if it had more variations some wider open level. But if you want nothing but a timewaster where you only need skill than I can recommand this.

Butcher, This game is amazing and I love the premise: basically playing as a Terminator sent down to Earth to mop up whatever survivors remain in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Hell yes. The gameplay itself is solid: very hard but never unfair. I m nearly at the end playing on Hard and I find it quite doable even if some levels take me many attempts. The combat is delightful with excessive overkill highly encouraged. The weapons are all extremely satisfying to use ammo is plentiful but not overabundant by any means and the sound design is fantastic. Levels are lovingly detailed and the music is wonderful. Death is frequent so respawning is quick and painless and it doesn t even reset the music -- which really helps keep you feeling like you re not wasting any time. There s little fanfare one way or another when you die. The game just sends you right back into the meat grinder. My only complaint is that some of the (totally optional) secrets are excruciatingly hard to reach and require you to exploit gameplay mechanics that aren t quite intuitive. You also have to reach the end of the level alive for those to count so if you spend a lot of time to get a hard secret only to die it s quite a setback. The game also has a level editor so I can see myself playing this for hours and hours and hours to come. It s quick to fire up quick to get into the action quick to reset after death and your weapons make short work of almost everything thrown at you. Even weapon switching is instantaneous so you truly can just focus on the killing and maneuvering just as a retro carnage-focused platformer should be. At $10 bucks this game is a steal.

Far: Lone Sails, ...while your landship constantly suffers catastrophic damage catches fire and burns you to death. This title absolutely defies genres and is overflowing with atmosphere and art and cool concepts and all that but it has zero replay value and lacks depth (or at least lacks defined depth). Where s our little guy (or gal) going? Why? What happened to the world? And several other unanswered questions. Actual gameplay consists of pushing your landships  go stop steam ventbuttons putting out fires and repairing components gathering fuel and using it and some minor puzzle figuring out. It actually all gets pretty tedious and the player will be thankful the games conclusion comes fairly quickly. I m glad I played it it was a neat experience. But I can t recommend it. Repetitious gameplay and absolutely no reason to ever start it up again after one playthrough equates to a sad thumbs down. Sad because it really does have a lot going for it.

Red Baron Pack," I poured countless hours of my youth into the original Red Baron mentally escaping to the skies above the western front for mission after mission after mission! I remember being teased in elementary school for reading the manual (which is a piece of art!) during ""free reading"" time. If that sounds like a sad story it isn t...because I DID NOT CARE!!! I was so caught up in the world of the WW1 flying ace I really could have cared less! Revisiting the original game 25+ years (!!!) on I find myself reflecting on what makes this game such a classic. I don t think it s the flight models - although each plane does have unique characteristics and handling properties it s hardly a profound connection between pilot and plane. It s also not graphics - although I recall the game visually being up to par back in the day it hasn t really held up (in my opinion) as ""timelessly artful"" or anything along those lines. No for me it really comes down to the experience of the pilot career and really LIVING the ebb and flow of the war and technology from early 1915 to the end of the war. You really experience swinging from being king of the skies armed with superior technology and numbers to woefully outnumbered and outclassed...and back again! I ve played countless video games between then and now and I m not sure any of them (save for perhaps Close Combat 3) have conveyed this kind of ebb and flow as effectively as Red Baron did. Red Baron II/3D is also wonderful - in my book it s superior in every single way to the original except in timing. The original just came along at a point in time in my life where my imagination was really open to being captured. Money well spent for me - tremendous memories and I really cherish being able to fire these up and getting transported back in time (in multiple senses of the phrase!)

Zak Mckracken And The Alien Mindbenders," Just to be clear GOG hasn t updated this game to work in modern Windows. What they ve gone and done is they ve used ScummVM a sort of emulator to support this old game. And that s fine! It works. But you should be aware of some issues. One if you have a widescreen monitor the game will stretch. It mostly looks okay but you should try to run it in a window if possible. Two mouse acceleration is insane it will jump all over the place. Running in a window might help that. (This is with mouse acceleration disabled in Windows.) Three and most importantly there doesn t seem to be save/load/exit functions. In the Amiga version it was F keys. Here press F5 to access ScummVM which handles saving. It also has an autosave. After accidentally skipping the plane sequence I found that autosave was just before that so I just quit. I have many fond memories of playing this game when it was new. My father a friend of his and I were all trying to get through it. I was maybe 10. We d get together and talk about our progress. I actually solved a couple problems but mostly I got help from the adults. This was before the Internet so we really had to solve everything on our own and it wasn t easy. Now I m 38 and my father (and his friend) have both passed and I m glad to play this game on PC. I ve tried playing it other ways (emulators and such) but if you re here reading this you probably know as well as I do that GOG games just work. I got it on sale but it s worth full price. Just want to throw a tip out there. You have more than enough money to complete the game and make a few mistakes. There is a way to exploit the lottery but I ll leave that to you to find. Hint: Bermuda. I will tell you that there are a bunch of ways to solve problems early on and one of them involves buying the hat and nose glasses from Lou s Loans putting them on and then giving the phone bill to the phone company rep.

Battle Chef Brigade Deluxe," This review is written just before the release of the ""deluxe"" content update. The game isn t perfect but this review will focus on what it does best what I enjoyed most and not so much the negatives which I found to be mostly insignificant. This game was spectacular. It has a lovable cast of characters that display some nice charming personalities. The characters are diverse and each have their unique flavour that isn t just another typical 1-trope character. Story is relatively simple and easy to follow but also quite enjoyable in its simplicity and straightforwardness. The progression follows Mina trying to join the Battle Chef Brigade and during the entrance exams she has to work for three mentors on various tasks as well as defeat her entrants in a cook off. It follows this progression for most of the chapters. Gameplay it is an addicting mix of match 3 and some light action platformer. You go out and explore the environment fill up your pockets with ingredients from plants or from defeating monsters and bring these ingredients back to the kitchen for your dishes. The exploration is incredibly light there are a few maps and each of them are small. This is not a metroidvania style game where you have free reign to explore. You are always going to be delivering ingredients back to the kitchen and the cook offs are timed. The combat is fine not the best but pretty fun once you get the hang of it. The match 3 starts off very simple but progresses in complexity through the use of various cooking tools sauces and other such items. It is in a single word fun. I want to also praise the game for its diversity charm and general slice of life feel. Even when you don t get a whole lot of cutscenes or interactions between characters seeing them interact manages to evoke feelings of familiarity. The multiplayer and daily cook offs are also very addicting even for someone like myself who doesn t enjoy MP content much.

Cold Waters, Fun and intense game. Completely captures the feel of classic Microprose Red Storm Rising. Happy to say it s more than nostalgia. The cat and mouse underwater dog fight is genuinely exciting and dangerous. Casual players can select a lower difficulty level and make more use of the 3D view for tactical advantage at their own choice. The 3D view compliments the game play well. It is possible to play from that perspective though the game itself really takes place on a tactical map based on sonar data. The game UI experience lacks a little polish but is functional enough to enjoy. I ve completed half the single missions and one campaign at the time of writing.

Craft The World - Dig With Friends," ... and a miss. They tried really really tried to make players happy with a reasonable multiplayer experience but missed the mark again. It is better than the original MP mess but not by much. Once again they have added gimmicks instead of simply allowing you to ""dig with friends"". The base is now there you can join a seemingly regular game with multiple folks. However as of the first monster wave they just keep coming wave after wave no end. About ever five minutes. So you get about an hour of what you want then it devolves into a what amounts to a poor mans RTS. The infuriating part is folks used to counter complaints about the Biome system with ""its difficult to code"" etc. Well its all there now they simply had to force you into this ""survival"" mode for reasons unknown. And it could be fixed with the greatest of ease and allow people to toggle it on and off. I get that it would upset the balance of the game have double the dwaves but for gods sake at least make it a choice. And there is no workable solution in creative mode. Spawn cubes are not remotely the same thing. Simply allow players to enter the campaign mode with other players Its all there now just allow the survival toggle). Done and done. Unreal my level of disappointment with this release. I gave it two stars since the other little changes they added were great.

Freedom Force, I ve played they game many times since 2002. The story is stock but the scope of the game is unmatched in my humble opinion. Yes it would be wonderful if someone bought the rights and developed a 2020 version I think it would sell very well considering the MMO s are drying up in this genre. Anyway I digress the key feature for me is the vast array of start up options and after a single run through you can import custom characters from marvel or dc.

Star Wolves 2, Star Wolves 2 starts on a very low note as the intro already shows some of the worst attrocious voice actings I ve ever heard - delivered without any sense of passion and punctuation sometimes the speaker even pauses during line breaks! The game mostly plays like the original Star Wolves - mothership equipment even the characters are pretty much instantly familiar to players of the first part. Speaking of equipment... you start the game with tier 2 equipment which in itself is okay I guess but the game features randomly generated optional missions some of which paying out a whopping 500k and more which instantly allows you to upgrade all your stuff to the best money can buy. The worst bit about those missions however is not the danger - it s having to trudge across multiple pretty much completely empty systems. You accept the mission in a star base travel towards your client (often through several systems...) then towards your goal then back to the client. Any threat that may have been present will not respawn or be randomly generated so once you cleared out a system of the 1-2 enemy squads inhabiting it you ll have a completely safe passage. Not that you d need it after the aforementioned quick upgrade to space-godlike equipment. The story might be nonlinear I will never know - in one of the early missions I decided to help out some pirates which seems to have insulted the game so much that it decided never to give me a main objective again. To make things worse the game also crashed a lot. Entering starbases leaving them travelling through systems entering combat picking up stuff equipping your fighters... all those things were likely to crash the game which means you ll also have to save your game more often than would be convenient. This is pretty much Steam Greenlight levels of bad but we are talking about something that is sold as a finished product here. , April 23 2016, Star Wolves 2 starts on a very low note as the intro already shows some of the worst attrocious voice actings I ve ever heard - delivered without any sense of passion and punctuation sometimes the speaker even pauses during line breaks! The game mostly plays like the original Star Wolves - mothership equipment even the characters are pretty much instantly familiar to players of the first part,lopez8557,a
Oceanhorn: Monster Of Uncharted Seas," I recently played Wind Waker for the first time with a very nostalgic friend who wanted me to experience it. Playing Oceanhorn afterwards it amuses me that this game does a rather good job of being how she _remembered_ Wind Waker. Actually playing Wind Waker: ""Okay eventually we ll get an item that makes boat travel a lot faster..."" ""Um I guess this is one of the filler dungeons but most of them are really good...well some are."" ""The art looked really great back then. Look at all the bright colors..."" I think if you are a Zelda fan you will like this game a lot because it improves on a lot of the grind areas. It s not quite as good in that it is mostly a copy but it doesn t do anything worse than Wind Waker necessarily. It does greatly improve on voice acting... For Zelda haters: you won t like it. Your character can t jump the combat is simple and constant you just keep playing to win eventually most of the content is optional collection/exploring stuff you play as a child (why does anyone trust stretched-collar boy with their destiny?) the environmental world-building is crap (there are three people in this town and the only woman is elderly)...all the stuff you probably hate about Zelda games. I m giving it 4/5 for ""above average Zelda clone"" but I personally found it tedious.

Alan Wake, Honestly I m not into Horror/Survival Games but biting through this one was well worth it. Combat is not the most enjoyable (or I just suck - I often suck) but story and athmosphere are one of a kind and the game is heavily focused on the latter. The soundtrack is also great and the chapter-ending-tracks are extremely well picked. Also there are a lot of Horro-Movie/Book references to enjoy if you re into the genre! If you re more a story-related-person get this game! You ll be rewarded. I m a motion-sicky and some parts of the game as well as camera controls generally can be VERY exhausting. I had to play it in bits and often take a pause or switch with a friend in the later parts especially but it s possible to finish it. (I own the game on Steam and played with a controller. Can t say about how good the GOG version works.) , November 6 2018, Honestly I m not into Horror/Survival Games but biting through this one was well worth it,wilkinson,a

Perimeter, I don t normally write reviews but this game is so utterly crap that I feel I have a responsibility to warn others about it. I set out looking for a good RTS with a simple and descriptive interface. I did not find that in Perimeter. All I found here was a confusing and boring game with few options and limited controls. Not only are there no descriptions or tooltips for units or buildings but you only get a limited number of builders which you have to distribute as either ground maintenance (they call it terraforming but it s more like watching slow old ladies working in the garden) or building builders. Seriously you only get like 5. Another thing is that your army turns into a blob of tiny pixel-units. Your whole army becomes basically one unit. Even if you have multiple objectives on a mission you have one blob-unit to take care of everything. Or maybe I m stupid and just couldn t figure out how to split them into smaller armies but as I said before: this game lacks in descriptions instructions and tooltips. The story is original but you just can t make up how horrible the gameplay is. I was so frustrated with this game that I dove right back into searching for a good RTS that I forgot to get my money back for this thing. At this point I just wish I could remove it from my library. , May 1 2016, I don t normally write reviews but this game is so utterly crap that I feel I have a responsibility to warn others about it,curry,a

Darkstar One, I bought a box copy years back and played it. I was looking forward to the game as there was little in the flight sim market at the time this was before Star Citizen or No Man s Sky was visible. Just to give you a gauge of my taste I m an old fan of Wing Commander and Freespace including both Privateers and Rebel Galaxy. I didn t have any expectations of this game but I know what I like. The game started off okay. The graphics are pretty and all. I saw that there was an interesting system by which to develop the starship it not bothering me that there s only one and what appeared to be a fairly open universe to play around with. As time went on I figured out a few things. The world is fairly open but the missions do moderately funnel you into a particular direction. The universe serves no other purpose than to act as a backdrop to the main story. No side stories. No varying experiences or characters. The starship can be equipped to be anything from a speedy skirmisher to a hefty gunship but it s going to center around direct confrontation and when you pass a certain threshold you become untouchable by the enemy. I created a multi-gun corvette and I would simply fly by as my automated turrets tore holes in everything. I rarely dodged a shot. This became boring. Since I was funneled into a single storyline it better be good. Instead it was a bland story with horrible voice acting unrealistic dialogue the cheesiest ending and a final mission I couldn t lose even if I sabotaged my own efforts. In the end it s a movie that has a flashy opening sequence but then becomes a cliche and ends trying to sell you a twist you saw coming from a deus-ex-machina mile away that you kept trying to refuse but was forced into your arms anyway. So I finished it shelved it and there it has stayed for reasons I can t fathom. , October 16 2018, I bought a box copy years back and played it,ruiz2784,a

Monster Bash," Ah the great Monster Bash which started my platform gaming and which I demanded to have for Christmas as a full game. Episode one alone stood for some awesome eye candy with multiple animated actions many enemies the main character Johnny Dash doing different actions (like walking running crawling climbing shooting flying a broom even shooting at you the player if you idled for too long) for a 10-year old me it was an astonishing feat to see. Now that GOG has all three episodes there is no need to convince anyone anymore to ""purchase the remaining two"" as Apogee put it back in the day - that was the shareware model. Instead you now get all three episodes here and trust me they are really worth of the price GOG is offering you. I remember when my mom bought it for me for $35 back in 1994! All three episodes (or Monster Bash) include 30 levels in total with all increasing in difficulty and a LOT of different enemies and puzzles (there are hints available to help you though). Only the last 10 levels are of mild challenge though but trust me the graphics and animations which were outstanding in 1993 the music puzzles and gameplay are totally worth to pick up this in my opinion the best Apogee game of all time!

Evil Genius, This is a game I missed when it first came out. Something just didn t charm me into buying it. Thanks to GOG I got that second chance. I don t regret buying it now just maybe more that I never back then. As good as it is and it s addictive and quirky it feels lacking in something some magic and maybe that is more about it belonging to a previous generation of games more than it not being exceptional. The music is good graphics look dated but still playable. Animations are surprisingly as good as we get nowadays and in the case of Mass Effect Andremda far better! It s simple to pick up easy to play and a fantastic game. I don t however find it funny that was a selling point people found it funny. Maybe I ll get my funny bone checked out at Two Point Hospital when that comes out... I just feel like It s missing some gameplay or time has caught up with it. I ve spent many an hour on the world map wondering if that is all there is to the game once your base has max occupants and you re waiting for the challenge bits to be accessible moving the sttory/events on requiring hitting certain infamy levels and due to this it feels a bit grindy. I d recomend it to anyone that had it back in the day as it s still addictive and as good as most games out there I feel that my review is scored on the fact that after 2 decades of hearing how awesome it is I still don t see it maybe for what others do a classic. , April 15 2018, This is a game I missed when it first came out,decker,a

Quest For Glory 1-5, The VGA remake of the first Quest for Glory would have to be my favorite game in the whole point and click genre. I haven t really liked many other adventure games but Quest for Glory mixes RPG elements with point and click adventure and it s wonderful. Especially for someone like me who enjoys RPGs far more than adventure games. You can pick one of three classes at the beginning; fighter mage or thief. This choice will determine how you ll be overcoming many of the obstacles in the game. It also adds a lot of replay to the game since you can go through it again with a different class to change things up. The remake still looks good today and has a great intuitive interface. The combat is pretty simple but I felt the later games made it too awkward to control. This first game had the right idea. Like most Sierra games Quest for Glory doesn t take itself very seriously and is often quite funny--which I like. I ve played a lot of point and click adventures but I still go back to play through Quest for Glory to this day and for me that proves it s still one of the very best this genre has to offer. , October 12 2018, The VGA remake of the first Quest for Glory would have to be my favorite game in the whole point and click genre,hester9782,a
Phoning Home, bought this game a while ago never really got around to playing it until now and WOW it did not disappoint. the story is new but good the world is beautiful pretty much normal size but the dessert world is big and I mean big and fun to explore. Although there is a slight touch of feminist ideology it is very slight and does not really interfere with the story line or game play the characters grow on you with the game and I personally quite enjoyed them. the game is a survival story driven narrative kind of game with some very interesting mechanics creative world environment and enjoyable characters.

Etherlords, As it is case with some originals overshadowed by their sequels (take Baldur s Gate 2 for example) Etherlords is pretty average game. Due to weird design of turns (your heroes move at the end of a turn not during it) and castle  siegesmissions are often series of silly chases who will get to enemy s castle first and start chipping it turn after turn. Which is both boring and cheap yet necessary strategy. Factions are unbalanced big time - Chaots will aggro rush you with rats pumping them and pinging your hero with spells but as Vital you will have to upgrade our deck to fliers and ramp spells as soon as possible. Too many times you will have to fight with enemy hero who has much better deck and higher hp what s worse - many times there is no way but to soak damage and painfully wait to draw better cards as it is case with Kinects. Overall battles are either banale affair of stomping on some low level enemy or game of ehxaustion. The lack of second cast/end phase/instant spells takes any chance from battles to have a depth and more strategic layer. It s just a damage race. tl;dr Just play Etherlords 2 which is much better game without weird turn system and much more interesting campaign. , September 23 2018, As it is case with some originals overshadowed by their sequels (take Baldur s Gate 2 for example) Etherlords is pretty average game,garrett9404,a
Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.4 Himatsubushi," Tatarigoroshi is the third game in the Higurashi When They Cry franchise. Each game explores events in Hinamizawa Village over the same two weeks in 1983 as an annual curse is about to strike for the fifth year running. Each game presents as a separate ""what if"" timeline - as players learn what the timelines have in common they gain the clues necessary to solve the overall mystery. The games come with significant caveats: (1) There is no meaningful interactivity in these games - no choices no decisions no customisation. It s literally a linear novel presented in visual novel format. The ""game"" is intended to be the player solving the mystery by reading the text. (2) They re slow - there s a *lot* of slice-of-life nonsense in each game before the main plot develops - slightly less in this chapter but still. (3) There s a certain amount of ""damn it Japan"" as there often is in this genre. Expect inappropriately sexualised children. With all that the games are unique well-written and reward patience. If you are intrigued by chapter 1 stick with the series. If you re not there s nothing here that will change your mind. As for this particular chapter - Tatarigoroshi - it s the best of the early chapters. The story is darker more grounded in reality and better paced. Those playing through will feel encouraged by this chapter to continue. ", October 4 2018, Tatarigoroshi is the third game in the Higurashi When They Cry franchise,morrison,a
Eador. Masters Of The Broken World - Allied Forces, You can barely use the content of this DLC. All new units are high level upgrades to race units. If you played the base game already you will know that all race units are available only after completing a quest. Since quests are randomized you are in a midgame when you finished them. All race units are tier 1 so in the midgame they will do close to nothing (tier 2 is much more powerful). To use new unit from this DLC you need to level up a race unit high level (like 10 or so). In the midgame those units die to anything so leveling requires many patience and is difficult. That means that you can use those units in end game where other units are more important anyway.

Eschalon: Book I," But to be honest it has a lot of flaws. If I had paid for it I d be really pissed and try to get my money back. Just the fact that you need 1000 points just to get to level 1 is a big problem for me. Almost every single game I ve played starts you out with easy things to do to build up your character and level up and ease you into the game. Another flaw you can t just ""find"" or harvest spell components you have to buy them which brings us to the amount of gold (or lack there of) that you get finding it in chests or for doing things. Yes you can save the game before you open up a barrel chest sack skeleton or coffin and if you don t like what you get reload the save and try again but this is seriously lacking as well. In most other games you get experience for doing things and achieving things This game is VERY stingy about giving you experience points. Another flaw is the map. It shows you where you are and all that but when you bring up the larger ""Whole World"" map it doesn t show you where you are on it. One of the biggest though is the fact that I had a thug down to the barest of life bars hit him 20 times and he still managed to kill me!

7th Legion," Yeah don t believe the fanboys who give everything 5 stars. There isn t really anything worthwhile about this game. First it s short. So short I finished it in one sitting. It would have taken less time if it wasn t so buggy. It s a bad sign when the readme file tells you ""When this bug happens do this with the cursor to get control of your units back."" And that s one that came WITH the game. This RTS has no resources. None. You get credits just for being alive. The manual has more pages about the battle cards then anything else. Want all your units to die instantly because ""Other guy played a card"" well woo! That s not an RTS. Now from the credits screen it looks like one guy programmed the whole thing so kudos to him. There are 3 pages of QA people. They did a crappy job since so many bugs remain. It s just frustration on a stick. Made worse by the fact the game runs too fast on modern DX. You d think by the mid 90s people would know to put in time delays. You can fix some of the speed issues with the DXWRAPPER GOG is using to make the game run but the title screen still runs at 600fps. I did not play this before but I suspect the ""fog of war"" returning almost instantly is a side effect of the game running too fast.

The Silver Case," This game involves typing long words into a primitive interface but you can t just type the word with your keyboard you have to select each letter of the alphabet by scrolling through all the letters of the alphabet with an arrow key one letter at a time. The puzzle solving amounts to typing these words into a decoding panel getting a gibberish code out of the decoding panel and then retyping that gibberish into the first panel. This is not challenging it s just boring busywork. I would not stay at a job that required me to do this mindless crap -- why would I do it for fun? If the storytelling was compelling I might stay but my teammates are one-dimensional and have no personality and I can t even see them on screen. They are supposedly in the room with me as I solve these puzzles but you can t see them -- you wander through bland empty environments your teammates are supposed to be in with you but they are invisible. The music is an incredibly repetitive loop and when I tried switching from the remixed music to the original music it sounded exactly the same. The game tries to give an impression of being visually interesting by having random words flash in various parts of the screen which just clutters the interface.

Serious Sam S Bogus Detour, Bogus Detour is just like Serious Sam except topdown. It just has a few issues that ruin the game for me. The weapon shortcuts have been slightly altered compared to every other Serious Sam game seemingly for no reason. Due to this I kept getting the wrong weapons. When a weapon ran out of ammo the game switched me to the flamethrower which is near useless. Enemies take more damage than they should it s just not enjoyable. This is especially a problem with bosses that just go on forever. The final boss is ridiculous with four players I ve beaten it alone. Together we could not do it in like four hours. There s no map or minimap this would be fine if not for the fact that every level is sprawling with plenty of secrets and places to get lost. All of these issues just add up and make the game a pain. Even in coop you won t be allowed to have much fun as the lives are shared. Imagine dying and then spending 15 minutes watching others beat the level.

This Is The Police, Firstly the positives: the management of a police force and assignment of officers and detectives to crimes and cases is generally enjoyable. Voice acting is pretty good and music sets the mood well. The Poker was fun. Secondly the negatives: -Too few animations way too many still shots with voice-overs (that s like the other 5% of the game) -You literately play 95% of the time looking at a mini-map of the city in your office -The story is so crazy as to be unbelievable: journalists offer you money to kill your own officers (and the game presents it to you as an assignment) serial killers contact you asking for dead bodies the mayor tells you to fire all black police officers because of pressure from Neo-Nazis. -Sometimes simple choices have HUGE and implausible irreversible effects on gameplay: For example I decided to try fuel for the patrol cars from an old business partner which meant a kickback for me and as a result for the next two weeks until the end of the game I had to watch 2-3 of my officers die in car crashes every day making the game almost unplayable. Seriously what fuel causes cars to crash? -You can sometimes make choices for your officer???s actions on a call but they are so simple as to be redundant: a) use taser 2) throw a book at them 3) ask them for some drugs. The answer 90% of the time is TASER. The other 10% is mostly SHOOT. -There are points in the game where you are away from the department for health reasons when you get back all the staff are exhausted and drunk without any real explanation. -The representation of the church in the game is ridiculous. The Bishop heads a drug gang and ???blesses??? the drugs by bleeding on them??? -The save system is not well-implemented. -I THINK there are politics behind the game but they are done so poorly I can???t quite tell.

Puzzle Agent 2, Puzzle Agent 2 feels very much like a DLC for Puzzle Agent 1 rather than a full sequel. Nothing much is changed from the first game and whatever problems it had this game has as well. Such as unclear instructions to its puzzles repetitive puzzles and a difficulty curve that goes all over the place. Puzzles seem to either be ones a child can solve or ones you need mathematical knowledge to solve. I did find the puzzles here for the most part much easier than the puzzles in Puzzle Agent 1 but I suspect it s because some puzzles are taken directly from the first game while others are repeated so many times they become easy. And like the first game some puzzles have several possible solutions with the game accepting only one - usually the puzzles dealing with a series of numbers or objects. As far as plot goes it s a disappointment as well. The mystery behind the disappearances in the town of Scoggins was interesting but its conclusion seems hastily put together without much thought behind it. The game also feels a lot more linear than the first game which was already fairly linear. It seems you re always told where to go and what to do. You re never at a loss as to how to progress in the game. The dubbing in this game also feels like it s a step down from the first game maybe partly because there are so few conversations in this game. Overall Puzzle Agent 2 is a disappointment but having loved the premise so much I wouldn t mind playing a third installment. It would need to have much better quality control and have much more content to make it feel like a proper game and it d need to take place far away from Scoggins. That way maybe the series can reach its full potential. I just feel that with some extra effort put behind it Puzzle Agent 3 can be amazing. , July 14 2018, Puzzle Agent 2 feels very much like a DLC for Puzzle Agent 1 rather than a full sequel,caldwell,a
Beholder - Blissful Sleep, Pros: I liked the art style. The dreary look and feel really sells the atmosphere. The animation while not stellar is better than I expected. Unique concept - I haven t seen anything try this before. There s actually a lot of activity running around the building trying to plant cameras and such. I expected there to be a lot more standing around. There was surprisingly little. I found it funny that single socks keep showing up in the dryer. Maybe that s just me. Cons: Bad tutorial. Failed the first mission due to bad explanation of game mechanics - twice. Had to look up a walkthrough to do the very first mission in the game. Large loss of points for this. There s plenty of feedback about it being a problem for new players (Steam for instance) yet hasn t been fixed. It s utterly inexcusable. (For those wondering just seeing evidence isn t good enough. You have to click on the red text. Specifically the red text. Also the evidence you find is NOT listed as a crime by the directives you ve received at that time. So it s easy to just overlook it.) Secondly bad economy. I have no idea how to afford anything in this game. The quantities of money required to do anything beyond buying a repair kit is unreal. How are you supposed to come up with thousands and thousands of dollars in just a few days game time? Thirdly even if you get passed that (yay memory editor) quest items are too well hidden or just don t show up. Where s an apple? The black market guy doesn t have one. Can t find one in any apartment. Walkthroughs say the black market guy has them. Talked to him on three completely separate occasions. He sure doesn t. Lastly other than the very first mission I never caught anyone doing anything illegal. It wasn t for lack of trying or lack of cameras. No odd red things in drawers or beds or whatever else. Never caught a red though bubble on a camera. I m completely lost for what to actually do here. , April 9 2018, Pros: I liked the art style,vang,a

Pinstripe," Brought to you by the same dev who you might remember from his previous work an obscure little browser game called ""Coma"". Which frankly I enjoyed a lot more than Pinstripe. Firstly because it s free and second it s much more concise. Pinstripe is barely 3 hours long and still feels padded. The worst aspect of Pinstripe is by far the gameplay itself. Being neihter a full adventure nor a real action game but the worst of both worlds. Ultra light platforming with floaty controls mixed with solving puzzles that are barely worth the effort. At the halfway point it turns into a collect-a-thon of all things. To reach the final area you have to backtrack to collect a certain amount of shinies before you can progress. Whyyy would you force your player through that. Story is the old ""Stuck in purgatory"" cliche. Which is neither a twist nor a spoiler because it s written in the very description of the game. Look up it says it right there. ""Discover the mystery behind Ted &amp; Bo s death."" The setting lends itself to some surreal senery and dialogue which I did find intriguing. Albeit sprinkled with a bit too much toilet humor for my taste... the game s riddled with fart noises insults containing the word piss and the like. If you just want some weirdness for weirdnesssake Pinstripe may keep you distracted for one afternoon. Set your bar low though. (As an aside one thing that made me chuckle while watching the credit s roll...Danny Sexbang of Game Grumps fame did a voice. That s neat I guess?)

Empires Of The Undergrowth, The other reviews says it all but the game needs more attention as this game is great. It seems the devs takes their time and give us quality.

Shelter, What beautiful art style and game atmosphere in this one. I have only just begun to enjoy my time in Shelter but already I am loving so much that its shown so far. I love the minimalistic UI and the clever lighting from inside the tunnels to outside during daylight. Even the simplistic controls and gameplay ensures the experience is authentic to the actual life of a badger mother and her pups. In Shelter you play as a mother badger and you traverse the overworld in search of food to ensure the pups that follow you around don t fade away. You can ram trees that have red fruit hanging from the branches or rip up root veggies for your pups to fight over. I like that you can place food directly in front of the most faded pup since the nearest pup will always go for the food. The game feels authentic to nature and to the natural atmosphere it creates. The plot is not told through text but through the situations that happen as you experience the landscape. It impressed me in how simple it was but how profound an experience it left me with. Again it must be said how lush and relaxing the landscape was. I have been playing on windows 10 with mouse and keyboard and barring some clunky camera controls actually enjoyed every other bit about the game. In terms of replayability I wouldn t be opposed to a return romp through after some time has passed. I appreciate the calm but invigorating feeling you get from experiencing a simulation game this pure that it truly immerses you into the mind and even essence of the Badger. Replayability is where I definitely feel Shelter is most weak in so you might not revisit this experience again... so enjoy it!

Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend Of Rhythm Alien, There is always a delay after I press jump. I really tried to continue playing the same level over and over again but e.g. a slight delay before the latter ruins the level. The background color is almost the same as enemy color. Seriously? Didn t anyone QC the game before release? And in the soundtrack there are no certain rythm points to give feedback the user. The animation is also just not synch d with the ryhtm. I think I ll give this series another chance - getting the first game. Maybe only fun in the first 30 minutes not more. , October 10 2018, There is always a delay after I press jump,hale5812,a
La-Mulana 2," Do you like Myst? Do you enjoy needing to apply abstract and Z-&gt;A logic in solving puzzles? Are you the kind of person that plays puzzle and adventure point/click titles for those AH HA! moments--the thing puzzle solvers live for. Well this game is your huckleberry. Are you the kind of person that is typically disappointed in puzzle games because  that puzzle that could have been amazing was a total letdown and the game just literally solved it for you etc. etc.If you allow this game to satisfy your inner puzzler/inner Indian Jones I m sure it won t disappoint! 1st: If you have not played the first game you should play the first game before this. It is known as La Mulana on stores and known in circles as ""La Mulana Remake"". 2nd: This game will challenge a puzzle solver. You will be tempted to cheat--seriously don t. It ruins your experience and ultimately means you repeatedly make the same problem solving errors. As a puzzle solver there s one thing I look for in reviews and when I ask friends that played a game--is the game fair? Everything in this game is absolutely fair but be warned you may feel that thing you never feel in games...feeling stuck...feeling lost.

Back To The Future: The Game, Telltale Games from that period were mostly uninspired in my opinion. They had good licences huge potential but character development was often embarrassing (except for some Sam &amp; Max episodes here and there). Dated graphics (back then) unmoving stories and worst of all: almost every character is a clich??. No depth. Don t expect LucasArts-type characters it s just going to be Humongous-type characters -- except that it s targeted at older players. Storytelling could have been so much much better from a studio whose name is Telltale. Anyway??? I could still recommend it if you re NOT looking for strong storytelling but the humor ain t that good here and the puzzles are just okay. It s just nice to see the Delorean again. Moreover GOG doesn t ship as of 2018 the macOS version that Steam has so well??? , October 21 2018, Telltale Games from that period were mostly uninspired in my opinion,dejesus3738,a
Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition, I played this game with my wife and enjoyed it a ton. Great art and a fun setting really make it approachable and getting through the story is simple enough however there are plenty of challenges to keep the hardcore players hooked. My wife and I love playing games together and this has been one of our favorites. I will say that some of the challenges are a tiny bit easier if only one player is doing them but you can have player 2 drop out to get past those sections if you need. Overall a really fun game that you should not hesitate to play if you are into local co-op at all. , November 4 2016, I played this game with my wife and enjoyed it a ton,gilliam6887,a

Nine Parchments, Just like any bunch of wizards in training the cast of Nine Parchments make a mess of things. The gameplay really exemplifies this. If you can grab some friends start the first level and not start murdering eachother then my pointy hat goes off to you. This is a game about constructive chaos learning to make it work with a bunch of spells that don t want it to work and hearing every sumptuous bit of dialogue on offer. Like Magicka Nine Parchments is a (up to four player) multiplayer romp through a magical world with friendly fire permanently on. You fry enemies--and eachother. You freeze monsters--and eachother. You electrically charge giant healer-geese--and eachother. Cackling maniacally while doing this is optional. Unlike Magicka this game has characters. From the foppish Cornelius to the baker-gone-pyro Corniffer the dialogue is a treat. It is well delivered before each level with banter segments at the beginning of a new chapter. There is a great sense of maneuverability in Nine Parchments. Jumping teleportation and strafing are the bread and butter of survival; A daunting task on the harder skill levels. I ve put many many hours into trying to topple Hardcore Mode (my recommendation for play) and it is a beast. After 50 or so attempts I still haven t conquered it (Oh but I will). Curated fights are a strong centerpiece here. One moment you feel unstoppable as you crush dark-enchanted enemies with a well placed healing spell. Next round you realize you didn t round out your fire portfolio and are frozen in a block of ice before you can dent an ice-beam gang. It s tough but progress is possible as you learn more about the game encounters and discover your favorite catalogue of spells (you get one after every boss fight). Hours into looking for unlockable new characters spells and accessories beating hard core on the 28+ levels and enjoying the breathtaking graphics and vistas I gave this game an unequivocal recommendation. Enjoy! , June 11 2018, Just like any bunch of wizards in training the cast of Nine Parchments make a mess of things,zamora,a

Vangers," ..... I m just finding this a frustrating experience at the moment. The absolutely GODAWFUL controls of your ""mecho"" which bounces around totally at random at the slightest lump in the terrian (and believe me there are A LOT OF LUMPS) is just ruining it for me. Added to that I can t seem to get anywhere due to the constant harrassment from other mechoes who seem to just ram my mecho destroying easily yet not appearing to be harmed by ramming themselves and they never seem to run out ammo unlike me who runs out after barely a dozen shots. Even if I have the CrotRig which allows me to hide underground they STILL follow me around like flies on dogshit! Added to that there are NO cheats thanks to a Napoleonistic anti-cheat developer who says ""no cheats tuff tits thats how the game should be"" makes it worse. (Well hello Mr Derek Smart look-alike) Then the so-called ""spiral station"" starts refusing to charge my ""spiral device"" (use to access the games stargates) so I can no longer jump to other levels. Sorry but it s time to throw in the towel I ve got over 150 other GOG games waiting to be played..... life s too short for Vangers I m afraid. If not for the frustrating controls and unfair shit from all the other ""vangers"" and lack of any help on the games forums with some of it s bugs (eg the store item description crash bug) this would be a charming utterly original game with an original story behind it (such a rare thing these days) I d have given this five stars like most others have!

8-Bit Armies," This is a modern game in the form of a classic RTS. There s no ultra configurability (like in Earth 2150 or Warzone 2100) no real plot no story-telling no tactical ""precision strike"" missions or whatever. But what you /do/ get is buckets of fun blowing things up. There is the occasional annoyance - the units require quite a bit of micromanagement there s no real warning that units or buildings are under attack and the isometric perspective hides some smaller units. Playing through on the  easymode will mean you can win by flooding the enemy with lots of units. Do that on  hardmode and you ll lose - it takes a little more strategy (but not too much). Definitely worth getting especially on sale. ", October 30 2018, This is a modern game in the form of a classic RTS,valenzuela2316,a

Ultimate General: Civil War, This game is quite easy to get into but has a good amount of depth and challenge. In fact I often fall asleep thinking about how I will place my units the next time I fight a particular battle. The game has two components. There is a light management component where you create/equip regiments divisions and corps; assign skills and bonuses to your army and your units; and choose whether to participate in some minor battles. This is all pretty streamlined and simple once you get used to it but there is also great depth here. Do you want to focus on lots of small units or a few huge brigades? Do you want an army heavy on artillery? Should they have close-range or long-range guns? How are you going to pay for that? Or maybe you want lots of cavalary units? If so should they be outfitted for charging into enemy ranks or for dismounting and fighting? Once you figure out these questions between battles you actually get down to the fighting... The actual battles are a wonder to behold. It s easy to start moving your units across the beautiful maps; just click where they should go and on what they should attack. Anyone can grasp this. The real challenge is more abstract: figuring out where and when to defend or trying to find weak points to attack or which units require the presence of your general and so on. Making these choices is hard; acting on them is easy thanks to the intuitive interface! I expect that I ve got about 50-60 hours in this game by now and I am only up to Gettysburg in the Union campaign. This game is a great value. P.S. If you don t want to bother with campaign modes there are a lot of stand-alone scenarios you can jump right into. , August 3 2018, This game is quite easy to get into but has a good amount of depth and challenge,sanders,a

The Flame In The Flood, I really wanted to like the Flame in the Flood. The music is fantastic and immersive the setting and concept are interesting and I love survival games. Despite framerate and quirky input issues (Mac) the game charmed me enough to make maybe a dozen runs before regretfully concluding that I was not having fun. Maybe I just wasn t getting it but here are some of the things that irked me: - Food. The hunger bar ticks down so fast that the game feels like a time trial to get from snack to snack but of course you have no idea where the next snack is. I like taking my time in games but that didn t seem to be an option because of how fast your hunger ticks away. I died once because my hunger bar was at about 20% when I got on the river. I couldn t manage to steer and manage my inventory at the same time so I starved to death with a pack full of food when the hunger bar hit 0 on the water. - Speaking of the game doesn t pause when menus and dialogs are open. That created alot of very frustrating circumstances often involving dying of hunger/thirst because I couldn t navigate the menu quickly enough or being gored by a boar because I was fumbling to close a dialog. - There are lots of procedurally generated quests that I never actually got to do because they didn t match any of the procedurally generated areas that I encountered. - I actually thought it was cool how illnesses work: Start off fine; If you don t treat them they get worse and make your life harder and eventually kill you. In practice though there aren t enough opportunities to actually deal with your illnesses at ALL so an illness is a death sentence with a 15 minute delay. - The rafting part is actually really cool but sometimes the controls just do the wrong thing. I m not talking about rapids and currents-- That part seems to work pretty well-- I m talking about my controls not responding to input. Overall I thought TFITF was almost good but it just got too much wrong to be fun. , August 26 2018, I really wanted to like the Flame in the Flood,malone6181,a

Realpolitiks," Realpolitiks has great ideas and potential but fails in pretty much anything it tries. If you are used to the Paradox games do not even try this one. I will try to summarize the problems it has so you can decide if you want to give it a go anyway. The war system does not make any sense. You and your enemy choose a strategy that your troops should be doing so no real troop deploymeny. It does not follow logical sense; like if the enemy plays ""Take vital cities"" how is ""Cut supply lines"" not the best option but results in instant defeat? The best thing is to save scum and select what the developers thought was best. The whole policy tree is broken. Policies can be bought and maintained by gold and action points (economic power). The maintenance is based on your population and your GDP; the higher these are the more expensive policies are. This means that over time your nation becomes weaker over time (if you think you play well). I played a medium sized nation became #1 in ranking and in 2090 I lost so many action points per month that I couldn t do anything anymore because of my extremely high GDP and slightly bigger popultation. I removed policies to reduce maintenance but even when everything was removed I had a net loss. I was just literally waiting until the game timer ran out. Fun right? The constant attack by rebels. Imagine a peaceful country that is not expanding... Why would hordes of terrorists (that have the same size or bigger armies than yourself) be constantly attacking your country? How is this realistic? And my biggest complain in the end is that the game is way too easy. In my first playthrough I choose a relatively mediocre nation and won. I won pretty much all space races and events resulting in the highest score. I never broke a sweat. Is this game easy or am I that good? All in all; this game is broken. The policy tree is neat and the events are interesting but the game in it s current state is just not done. I had high hopes.

Blade & Bones," As some already say the combat isn t the best and has some flaws it has quite a few bugs (Like AI getting stuck and not responding to anything Entering a Boss Battle again which you already defeated but no Boss spawning so getting stuck in the Boss area..) and also a few misspelling text or even a spoken Dialog word that s diffrent from a word in the subtitle (it s only a single word that is diffrent but the meaning/interpretation of the sentance would be diffrent if you would only focus on one of them) But not everything is bad it has a beautiful Graphics/Effects the Story is quite interessting but leaves quite a few questions it has Dozens of secrets and story bits and pieces all over the map which tries to answer the questions kinda like Dark Souls you have to run around and look for the writings and sort the story for yourself together. It has an interessting concept with the Time and Moon ""lights"" but only makes very little use of it thus far. I had quite fun exploring and figureing out how to get past the blocked paths and finding the secrets or story pieces but all in all this feels very unfinished even tho the regions are quite big it feels the enemies aside a bit empty i m most of the time running from a to b teleport then from c to d etc and after you memorised a region and solve ome of the puzzels you keep running past the enemies to search for the Next secret or solution for a puzzel. It also feels like the Devs are playing with some mechanics and hide a rare Sword there as a reward if you solve it but it s a one/two/or three time thing and you won t see it again.

Eden*, This is my first visual novel. It isn t a game but a book or an audio book (if you can speak in Japanese) with visual images and music to accompany the words. Adult content: This is NOT an erotic novel; there is some suggestive writing but it is mostly used for humor. There is no nudity (there is a single scene late into the game with a 2-piece swimsuit but that is as close to nudity as the game gets) and even scenes where blood is depicted in writing is not shown visually. In saying that apparently there is a patch available that will unlock erotic content but the GOG version I finished this novel with does not include this. I ll start with the bad: Visual Novel resolution: This visual novel uses a resolution of 1024x640 which I feel is pretty low even for it s first release in 2009. Story/Plot: The plot doesn t really get much attention at all it is very much a tool for which to create drama and build the characters. You will likely find yourself questioning certain plot points and decisions so a certain amount of  suspension of disbeliefis required to enjoy this novel. On to some good things: Characters: This novels strength is very much the characters and how they grow and change throughout the novel. The two main characters were especially well done and despite me not understanding the Japanese voices emotions were conveyed very well. Art: The art is very nice I just wished it was rendered at a much higher resolution. Music: There are several music tracks I enjoyed while reading this novel. On completion of the novel you get the ability to play the music tracks individually (within the program) of which there are 32.
